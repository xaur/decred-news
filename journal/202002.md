## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

A lot of work in Feb was focused on reworking the secp256k1 package to introduce specialized optimizations:

- secp256k1 package internals [made](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2056) independent of Go standard library crypto APIs to remove a lot of unnecessary expensive conversions and allow for more optimizations in the future
- signature verification [implemented](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2058) directly instead of relying on standard library which will allow optimizations specific for the secp256k1 curve
- introduced specialized code for [fixed-precision](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2060) field arithmetic which is significantly faster than arbitrary-precision big integers from the standard library and is also constant time, which helps to protect against certain side channel attacks. Careful gradual migration to use the new code brought speed and memory improvements.
- added optimized [square root](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2088) field calculation that is roughly twice faster than with big integers

Some optimizations are harder to review so great care was taken to introduce them in steps and thoroughly document all techniques used. If you love when math and fast bit-level computation come together this should be a delightful read.

In the big picture, the main benefits of the secp256k1 overhaul are improved speed and memory usage. Another important benefit is that once this is complete, secp256k1 operations will be constant time, which improves resistance to side-channel attacks. This is an important property for multiparty protocols that perform lots of signing, multisig Schnorr protocols being one example.

Other improvements:

- consensus code [made](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2031) a bit more robust by being explicit about the script forms it requires instead of [relying](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2036#issuecomment-583782693) on standardness policy code (e.g. what is permitted to enter to the mempool and be relayed across the network), which may change without a consensus vote
- allowed vote range [tightened](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2047) for mainnet to prevent an unlikely DoS vector
- tickets with non-approved inputs are now tracked [separately](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1852) to make block template generation and fee estimation more efficient
- added timeout parameters for [TCP connections](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2068) and [peer inactivity](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2067)
- rpcserver [made](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2066) explicit about the units it accepts (atoms vs coins) in code, help messages and API docs
- wire error types [defined](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2055), work towards [banning peers](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/350) not following the wire protocol

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

- added command to create [unsigned tickets](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1281) to facilitate offline staking and support Trezor staking in the future (Trezor firmware still needs to be modified to support Decred staking)
- added command to [create signature](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1611) for a transaction input script { what is this intended for? }
- added [discoverusage](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1643) command to manually trigger the discovery of address and/or account usage without restarting the wallet
- added RPC to start account [mixing service](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1635) which will be used by Decrediton
- repository module structure [simplified](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1642) to reduce maintenance burden
- added [package](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1664) for generating uniform cryptographically secure pseudo-random numbers
- changed peer seeding to use [HTTPS API](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1661) { correct? is it a change from DNS to HTTPS API where DNS is no longer used? }
- cleaned up the code

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton):

## Governance

In February the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 13,018 DCR and spent 12,622 DCR. Using February's daily average DCR/USD rate of $20.48, this is $267K received and $258K spent. At January's average daily rate of $18.00, the USD figure billed for work completed in that month is $227K. As of Mar 2, Treasury balance is 643,179 DCR ($11.6 million USD at $18).

Our Network [issue 6](https://ournetwork.substack.com/p/our-network-issue-6) had an interesting chart with Treasury inflows and outflows. As of Jan 30, the Treasury has received a total of 939K DCR and spent 299K DCR.

In February there were 4 new [proposals](https://dcrdata.decred.org/proposals) submitted, and 5 started voting.

- @Exitus' video production proposal which requested up to $2,400 per month was approved with 92.5% approval and voter participation of 24.8%.
- @Checkmate's second research proposal was approved with an approval rate of 81% and voter participation of 21.5%. It requested a budget of $17,500 to continue @Checkmate's research and other activities, including helping to get some charts from his and @permabullnino's work onto dcrdata. 
- The proposal for European marketing and events from @Haon and supported by @jholdstock, @kozel, @jazzah, @mm and @karamble initially requested $75,000 but reduced the budget to $49,000 and removed the Web Summit even in response to feedback. The proposal was rejected on Mar 3 by gaining only 38% support and voter participation of 25%.
- The Russian video production proposal was rejected with 21% approval and 20% turnout.
- The Decred Creative Economy proposal from oscargamboae was rejected with 3% approval, and becomes the first proposal to fail to meet the 20% quorum requirement, with just 15% of eligible tickets turning out to vote.

## Network

Hashrate: February's hashrate opened at ~427 Ph/s and closed ~356 Ph/s, bottoming at 263 Ph/s and peaking at 578 Ph/s throughout the month. Pool hashrate distribution as of Mar 1: Poolin 32%, UUPool 27%, lab.antpool.com 12%, BTC.com 1.7%, F2Pool 1.5%, Luxor 1.3%,  BeePool 0.1%, CoinMine 0.02% and others ~24% per [dcrstats.com](https://dcrstats.com/pow). Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was 132.1 DCR (-6.2) per dcrstats.com as of Mar 5. The price varied between 119.8-157.9 DCR. Locked amount was 5.40-5.65 million DCR, which corresponded to 48.49-51.19% of the circulating supply.

Since late Jan the amount of [staked DCR](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=k38z10xk-k7kaa0dk&bin=block&axis=time) experienced a ~30-day decline from ~5.65M to ~5.40M, or ~51.5% to ~48.5% (-3%) of the circulating supply, followed by a recovery to ~50%. The ticket price went down as low as 119.8 DCR but then quickly shot up to new levels.

Nodes: Throughout [February](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=1580515200000&to=1583020800000) there was an average of 165 public listening nodes and 341 total nodes per dcr.farm. Average version distribution for Feb: 40.8% use dcrd v1.4, 18.2% use dcrd v1.5, 9.1% use dcrd v1.5 dev and RC builds, 12.3% use dcrd v1.5.1, 4.1% use dcrd v1.6 dev builds, 4.7% use dcrwallet v1.4, 2.6% use dcrwallet v1.5, 2.1% use dcrwallet v1.5.1.

The amount of mixed coins (anonymity set) reached 20% of circulating DCR supply. Decred CoinJoin transactions mix between 50-100K DCR daily and on Feb 22 a new all-time high of 154K DCR [was hit](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1232746951294308356), equivalent of over $3 million. These numbers were mentioned by @Checkmate in Our Network [issue 10](https://ournetwork.substack.com/p/our-network-issue-10) ([tweet](https://twitter.com/spencernoon/status/1233450761566244865)). For current numbers, dcrdata alpha has deployed charts of [percentage](https://alpha.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true%2Ctrue%2Ctrue) of mixed coins and the [DCR amount](https://alpha.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=privacy-participation&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true%2Ctrue) mixed by day and by block.

## Integrations

There have been a [report](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$158343614832392oTHUs:decred.org) of a DCR holder taking losses to a scam Chrome extension for the Ledger wallet that asked for wallet seed. From the comments it looks like Google has removed it from the store but only after a few people got burned. Pay great attention to what software you trust the seed!

OKCoin decided to [suspend](https://blog.okcoin.com/scheduled-token-suspensions/) DCR trading because of low trading volume, despite being enthusiastic about Decred initially and even hosting several joint events.

KuCoin [announced](https://www.kucoin.com/news/en-decred-soft-staking-official-rules) on Feb 17 that it was going to begin staking its depositors' DCR two days later, on Feb 19. KuCoin users who hold DCR on the exchange were informed that they were being opted-in automatically, and instructed to withdraw their funds immediately if they wished to opt out.

> KuCoin will adjust the staking proportion of Decred every calendar day and calculate the daily revenue of the users (...) Users have to take note that due to the participation of the Program, there will be a potential risk that a user may not be able to withdraw his/her designated Decred in a timely manner or as he/she so expected although KuCoin will use its best efforts to avoid such inevitably delay.

As the staked DCR will be time-locked, KuCoin's capacity to provide it to depositors will depend on enough of their tickets voting, to free up the deposited DCR so that they can process withdrawals. 

> A Separate Project: The Service provided by KuCoin herein will only affect the Decred withdrawal, and will not directly or indirectly affect: (1) the trading of Decred assets on our platform; and (2) the trading or withdrawal of any other digital asset on our platform. As such, in the event that any user is reluctant to follow the withdrawal sequence but are already lined up in the withdrawal queue, the said user may choose to exchange Decred with other tokens, and withdraw the exchanged tokens immediately.

This indicates that, in a scenario where too much of KuCoin's DCR is staked to be able to meet withdrawal demand, users will still be able to trade that DCR on the market, e.g. in exchange for BTC. Any protracted delay in processing withdrawals is likely to depress the DCR price on KuCoin, if it becomes widely known that they are not able to meet withdrawal requests in a timely fashion.

The announcement does not specify any fee that KuCoin will collect for provision of this service. Whether this means they're not taking a commission, or the commission percentage is just not stated, remains to be seen.

Warning: the authors of Decred Journal have no idea about the trustworthiness of any of the services above. Please do your own research before trusting your personal information or assets to any entity.

## Outreach

On February 8th, Decred turned four, and the community celebrated the event with [#DecredGlobalMeetup](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DecredGlobalMeetup). Events took place in at least a dozen cities all across the world to celebrate the community and technology Decred has built. @Dustorf wrote [a blog](https://medium.com/@dlefebvr/on-saturday-february-8th-the-decred-blockchain-will-have-been-adding-blocks-for-4-years-17fe3038f3bf) and a [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/lefebvre_dustin/status/1225462426503696384) summarizing Decred's progress to date.

@Dustorf published a [Marketing Report](https://blog.decred.org/2020/02/26/Decred-2019-Marketing-Report/) detailing all project marketing related expenses in 2019. The report includes an examination of what worked and what didn't, as well as prescriptions for next year. The three high level recommendations include: imagine what can be achieved socially using the Decred technology stack, break the bubble to expand Decred beyond those currently in crypto, and leveraging the power of every individual within the community. The report calls for a decentralization of marketing efforts by geography. To that end, Latin America has already passed a proposal. The European proposal was made, but failed. It is expected that proposals for Brazil, United States, Canada, and Australia will be made in March.

The [decred.org website](https://decred.org/) was revamped, with a new visual aesthetic, a new explainer video, and new subpages that feature Decred's history and its three tenets: Secure, Adaptable, and Sustainable. The website reflects agreed upon messaging that positions Decred as a superior store-of-value based upon those three tenets.  

Decred in Depth released two episodes in February, [Decred, an Economic Breakthrough](https://decredindepth.libsyn.com/ammar-nasier-decred-an-economic-breakthrough) with @ammarooni and [DCR in LATAM](https://decredindepth.libsyn.com/elian-huesca-dcr-in-latam) with @elian. Additionally, @mr.black worked with @Checkmate and @permabullnino to release a new, trading-focused podcast titled [Rough Consensus](https://roughconsensus.libsyn.com/rough-consensus-1-rough-start).

DCR Comic launched the [dcrcomic.org](https://dcrcomic.org/) website hosting all work produced by the team, of which the latest comic is explains [Lightning Network](https://twitter.com/DCRComic/status/1229792848188444672).

@Checkmate published an extremely interesting piece about the [ProgPoW debate](https://medium.com/@_Checkmatey_/observing-ethereum-governance-during-the-progpow-debate-9bf1aec724ad) in Ethereum describing the shortcomings of Ethereum's governance system and how Decred's tools and methodologies can be employed to solve them. It is an excellent example of inserting Decred's points of differentiation into wider conversations, and was well-received by many in the Ethereum community, including [David Hoffman](https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1234653059424358400), co-host of the POV Crypto podcast.

@dezryth posted the first [update](https://scottrchristian.com/2020/02/15/dezryth-proposal-updates/) for his proposal for the month of January.

Monde PR came on board and quickly [established](https://github.com/decredcommunity/pr/pull/7) project public relations goals, target audiences, key messages, established credibility bullet points, documented key topics, performed a [competitor analysis](https://github.com/decredcommunity/pr/pull/8), documented all spokespeople, created key stories to pitch, and even began outreach, yielding a number of valuable placements:

- An [article](https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-state-of-blockchain-experts-weigh-in-on-adoption-around-the-world) in Cointelegraph featuring @elian and @akin's commentary on the adoption of blockchain around the world.
- An [article](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/does-china-control-bitcoin-and-ethereum/) in Finance Magnates featuring @jy-p's commentary on the centralization of Bitcion mining and consensus models.
- An [article](https://eng.ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-building-a-nation-on-the-foundation-of-maximalism/) in AMB Crypto featuring commentary from @richardred on Bitcion building a nation.

## Community Discussions

Comm systems news:

- The Slack bridge to Matrix and Discord was decommissioned on Feb 28 and most of the channels shuttered. Factors that contributed to the decision include the disrupting locking down of automatic invites in 2018, DMs and other history disappearing after about a week, and migration of most active moderators to Matrix. Those who wished to continue following and participating in the chats moved to Matrix and Discord, to the rest we say a fond farewell.
- @Exitus purged inactive accounts from Discord, cementing his iron grip on power among the denizens of Decred Discord. The pruning removed accounts that were not verified and had not logged on in over 30 days. Any account removed is free to re-join and go through the verification process.

Selected Reddit posts:

- @Checkmate shared his Decred [Wishlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/f4i870/decred_wishlist/), and others responded with their thoughts about @checkmate's suggestions, and some suggestions of their own.
- The Decred Marketing [Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/fa70c3/decred_2019_marketing_report/) saw 15 comments, some celebrating it, others taking issue with aspects of it.

Selected Twitter discussions:

- @Exitus identified and extracted a [clip](https://twitter.com/coveryfire7777/status/1229517588138528768) from an Ark Invest video, where Cathie Wood mentions Decred as "promising".
- @degeri [shared](https://twitter.com/degeri_crypto/status/1233658256737918976) a screengrab from Altered Carbon Season 2 Episode 5, where prices are quoted on screen in a range of cryptocurrencies, including Decred. DCR is the only currency shown with two numbers, and this cued speculation about what that meant for the interpretation of this year 2400 DCR price prediction.
- @jy-p is back on twitter after a long hiatus, and he's [wondering](https://twitter.com/behindtext/status/1232381271252271104) what people who work on cc projects and aren't actively engineering out oracles are doing.
- @richardred [thread](https://twitter.com/RichardRed0x/status/1231223498787508224) about Decred DAO, prompted by a [response](https://medium.com/@rzs/im-continually-amazed-at-the-lack-of-attention-decred-gets-4a40679246ba) on Medium asking why Decred was not featured in a DAO [update](https://medium.com/@rebeccarachmany/dao-falloff-and-revival-2cf74f3c18c1).

The Ethereum ProgPoW debate was re-ignited in style when it was approved to go into a hard fork on the core devs call, resulting in bafflement among many in the wider Ethereum community, where ProgPoW does not have as much support. This [post](https://hudsonjameson.com/2020-03-02-progpow-the-ethereum-community-speaks/) from Hudson Jameson gives an account of the history of ProgPoW and comes to the conclusion that while the change is probably good, threats to maintain a contentious hard fork must be taken seriously and it is not worth forking the network over. The Ethereum community is using a variety of signalling mechanisms, including Twitter [polls](https://twitter.com/crypt0snews/status/1231288498474209280) and EIP [open letters](https://github.com/MidnightOnMars/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2538.md) with hashtag campaigns. As Hudson's post details, there have already been extensive efforts to gauge Ethereum community sentiment about ProgPoW, and both a coin vote and miner vote were strongly in favor of ProgPoW. A variety of other methods have been used to gather signals from the community, including [Kialo](https://www.kialo.com/ethereum-and-programmatic-proof-of-work-progpow-30878) and likely a number of Reddit posts. @Checkmate has joined the debate with some [observations](https://medium.com/@_Checkmatey_/observing-ethereum-governance-during-the-progpow-debate-9bf1aec724ad) on how this is being handled, informed by his experience with Decred's approach. The problem with informal governance is that regardless of the amount of signal collection that takes place and whether everyone has a chance to speak, there will inevitably be a few people who have to make a judgment call and push forward to draw a line under it. It's a messy process and in the end very few people feel satisfied with the outcome.

There are indications of significant [strife](https://decrypt.co/19769/zaki-manian-cosmos-number-two-resigns) at Tendermint, the company behind the Cosmos blockchain - with number two Zaki Manian resigning from Tendermint to form his own Cosmos focused company, saying the CEO (Jae Kwon) is making progress difficult by under-resourcing development and focusing on a new project (Virgo) and Twitter persona (@jaesustein). This [update](https://gist.github.com/jaekwon/8861452eea20def46b89dfcc79c9212e#file-zaki_and_ref_god-md) from Jae illustrates the unusual degree to which the concept of godliness has come into play in the spat. Cosmos collected $17 million in a 2017 ICO, worth some $1 billion a few months later, in Mar 2019 the project raised another $9 million when the first iteration of the network launched, but the signs now are that progress towards a functioning blockchain hub has been limited since then.

Block.one CEO Brendan Blumer [woke](https://twitter.com/BrendanBlumer/status/1232318319061061632) up to find that the rules of the EOS network had been changed overnight, with 15 BPs proposing and passing the change to reduce issuance from 5% to 1%. That it happened is not exactly a surprise, because at no point has any significant effort been put into developing the planned "Worker Proposal System" described in the white paper. The unused 4% has been building up in an unused address, and the accumulated EOS has already been burned once. Why the WPF fund was finally shut down on this particular night 18 months later is a mystery that only the 15 EOS BPs involved know the answer to. Nobody even gave Brendan a heads up! He's fine with it though, rules changing overnight is how decentralized governance works when there are only 15 parties involved.

The Bitcoin ABC developers have [released](https://www.bitcoinabc.org/2020-02-15-miner-fund/) details of their plan to implement a variant of the block reward funding proposed by Jiang Zhuoer of BTC.TOP. This implementation will alter the following details of the plan: amount reduced to 5%, funds can go to any whitelisted project, and the plan will only go into effect if triggered by miners via BIP9. There remains considerable [opposition](https://twitter.com/PeterRizun/status/1228787028734574592) to the idea of any developer funding from the BCH block reward. 

Binance has been engaged in a [dispute](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-returns-frozen-btc-after-user-promises-not-to-use-coinjoin) with one of its users who had used the Wasabi wallet to CoinJoin mix their transactions and enhance their privacy. The mixing activity elevated the user's risk score and their funds were frozen while Binance investigated. Eventually the user agreed to withdraw their funds, which were not welcomed by Binance, who referenced compliance with Singapore law to explain their actions. So far there have been no reports of DCR mixers being flagged in this way.

The privacy implications of Ethereum Name Service (.ens) domains were considered by Tim Copeland in an [article](https://decrypt.co/19423/we-tracked-133000-ethereum-names-and-exposed-their-secrets) in Decrypt. Although many users were aware that they could damage their privacy by linking their domain address to their other addresses, the transaction they used to pay for their .ens could also be used to link them to their funds.

Blockstream are getting into banking, being named as a strategic technology partner of Avanti Financial Group, a [new](https://avantibank.com/) US bank dedicated to digital assets - [covered](https://coinspice.io/news/blockstream-bank-to-service-institutional-customers-plans-early-2021-opening/) by CoinSpice (with spicy illustrations).

Casa will focus on its $10/month subscription service for key management.

Justin Sun of Tron had a busy month, [buying](https://news.bitcoin.com/steemit-for-sale-tron/) the content website steemit.com which is built on (and the main use of) the Steem blockchain and immediately announcing that steemit.com would be moving to the Tron blockchain. This led the Steem witnesses (block producers) to enact a soft [fork](https://www.coindesk.com/justin-sun-bought-steemit-steem-moved-to-limit-his-power) which would freeze the "Steemit Inc ninja-mined stake”, an unknown large quantity of STEEM held in a number of accounts by the company. On Mar 1, Justin [struck](https://www.coindesk.com/steem-community-mobilizes-popular-vote-in-battle-with-justin-sun) back by recruiting exchanges (Binance and Huobi) to vote for a set of witnesses under his control that would revert the soft fork and free the Steemit STEEM. After backlash from users it appeared that both [Binance](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1234676941111742467) and [Huobi](https://medium.com/huobi-global/community-counts-a-letter-to-the-steem-community-340881448ea7) were going to unstake their STEEM and pull out of whatever arrangement they had with Sun. 

There has also been some [suggestion](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/did-justin-sun-rig-super-rep-election-two-tron-dapps-received-votes-from-zion-account/) that Justin Sun used votes from the "Zion" account to interfere with community voting - which he [appeared](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1230215220884201472) to confirm, stating that it was temporary until 3 super representatives upgrade their software, to "prevent them from harming the network".

IOTA's coordinator was turned off, [pausing](https://bitcoinist.com/iota-trinity-wallet-vulnerability-1-6-million-stolen/) the network, on Feb 13, to investigate claims of Trinity wallet thefts totalling $1.6 million. IOTA entered a state of elevated calamity when, after several days of down-time with the coordinator switched off, it was [revealed](https://blog.iota.org/trinity-attack-incident-part-1-summary-and-next-steps-8c7ccc4d81e8) that all the private keys of all users of the desktop Trinity client (maintained by the IOTA Foundation) had been compromised. 8.55 Ti of IOTA has been stolen, worth about $2.3 million at the time. Trinity was compromised by malicious code inserted in a 3rd party dependency of the MoonPay service that enabled users to buy IOTA tokens directly within Trinity. The [latest](https://cointelegraph.com/news/iota-prepares-to-relaunch-network-in-one-week) is that there is a fixed version of Trinity and a seed migration tool and IOTA holders have 7 days to undergo the transfer procedure before the foundation re-starts the network between Mar 7 and Mar 10. IOTA has lost 30% of its value in USD terms at time of writing (Mar 5), but users who hold their own IOTA have been unable to move them since the network was paused.

Aragon Court [launched](https://blog.aragon.org/launching-aragon-court/), aiming to provide a digital jurisdiction for DAOs to operate in. In Aragon Court disputes are resolved by jurors who stake ANJ tokens and try to guess the decision that the majority of jurors will choose. 247 jurors signed up for the launch by collectively staking 1 million ANT (worth ~$1.3 million). To start with jurors are completing a "[precedence campaign](https://blog.aragon.org/precedence-campaign-primer/)" (juror training exercise) with [mock](https://twitter.com/Yazanator/status/1228752714873462784) disputes. 

DeFi project bZx has been at the center of a number of [stories](https://www.coindesk.com/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-defi-flash-loan-attack) about exploits this month, with its new "flash loan" feature being used in creative ways to set up series of transactions that manipulated price oracles and immediately profited from them. The novel aspect of these exploits is that the transactions are all processed in the same block, either there is a profit for the attacker or the transaction is not valid - making it very low risk for the attacker as they are not required to provide collateral. After the exploit, the master key was used to edit the smart contracts so that they could not be executed the same way.

Another group came [forward](https://medium.com/@1inch.exchange/yes-we-hacked-bzx-fulcrum-but-one-month-ago-3f7e5c437ee3) to say they had warned bZx about a different issue a month earlier and were not impressed with their response, including refusing to pay a reasonable bounty based on a technicality.

12 exchanges were hacked in 2019 for a total damange of almost $300 million and 510,000 user logins, according to a January [report](https://cointelegraph.com/news/most-significant-hacks-of-2019-new-record-of-twelve-in-one-year) by Cointelegraph. This serves as a reminder to be cautious when selecting an exchange to send coins to.
