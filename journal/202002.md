## Governance

In February the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 13,018 DCR and spent 12,622 DCR. Using February's daily average DCR/USD rate of ${n.nn}, this is ${n}K received and ${n}K spent. At January's average daily rate of $18.00, the USD figure billed for work completed in that month is ${n}K. As of Mar 2, Treasury balance is 643,179 DCR ($11.6 million USD at $18).

Our Network [issue](https://ournetwork.substack.com/p/our-network-issue-6) 6 had an interesting chart with Treasury inflows and outflows. As of Jan 30, the Treasury has received a total of 939K DCR and spent 299K DCR.

In February there were 4 new proposals submitted, and 5 started voting.

* @Exitus' video production proposal which requested up to $2,400 per month was approved with 92.5% approval and voter participation of 24.8%.
* @Checkmate's second research proposal was approved with an approval rate of 81% and voter participation of 21.5%. It requested a budget of $17,500 to continue @checkmate's research and other activities, including helping to get some charts from his and @Permabullnino's work onto dcrdata. 
* The proposal for European marketing and events from @Haon and supported by @jholdstock, @kozel, @jazzah, @mm and @karamble {was rejected on Feb 3}.
* The Russian video production proposal was rejected with 21% approval and 20% turnout.
* The Decred Creative Economy proposal from oscargamboae was rejected with 3% approval, and becomes the first proposal to fail to meet the 20% quorum requirement, with just 15% of eligible tickets turning out to vote.

## Integrations

{ hint: new items of infrastructure or updates from existing }

Exchanges:

- Despite being enthusiastic about Decred initially, and even hosting several joint events, OKCoin decided to suspend DCR because of low trading volume https://blog.okcoin.com/scheduled-token-suspensions/
- KuCoin [announced](https://www.kucoin.com/news/en-decred-soft-staking-official-rules) on Feb 17 that it was going to begin staking its depositors' DCR two days later, on Feb 19. Kucoin users who hold DCR on the exchange were informed that they were being opted-in automatically, and instructed to withdraw their funds immediately if they wished to opt out.

> KUCOIN will adjust the staking proportion of Decred every calendar day and calculate the daily revenue of the users... Users have to take note that due to the participation of the Program, there will be a potential risk that a user may not be able to withdraw his/her designated Decred in a timely manner or as he/she so expected although KUCOIN will use its best efforts to avoid such inevitably delay.

As the staked DCR will be time-locked, Kucoin's capacity to provide it to depositors will depend on enough of their tickets voting, to free up the deposited DCR so that they can process withdrawals. 

> **A Separate Project:** The Service provided by KUCOIN herein will only affect the Decred withdrawal, and will not directly or indirectly affect: (1) the trading of Decred assets on our platform; and (2) the trading or withdrawal of any other digital asset on our platform. As such, in the event that any user is reluctant to follow the withdrawal sequence but are already lined up in the withdrawal queue, the said user may choose to exchange Decred with other tokens, and withdraw the exchanged tokens immediately.

This indicates that, in a scenario where too much of Kucoin's DCR is staked to be able to meet withdrawal demand, users will still be able to trade that DCR on the market, e.g.  in exchange for BTC. Any protracted delay in processing withdrawals is likely to depress the DCR price on Kucoin, if it becomes widely known that they are not able to meet withdrawal requests in a timely fashion.

The announcement does not specify any fee that Kucoin will collect for provision of this service. Whether this means they're not taking a commission, or the commission percentage is just not stated, remains to be seen.

## Outreach

On February 8th, Decred turned four, and the community celebrated the event with #DecredGlobalMeetup. Events took place in at least a dozen cities all across the world to celebrate the community and technology Decred has built. @Dustorf wrote [a blog summarizing Decred's progress to date](https://medium.com/@dlefebvr/on-saturday-february-8th-the-decred-blockchain-will-have-been-adding-blocks-for-4-years-17fe3038f3bf).

@Dustorf published a [Marketing Report](https://blog.decred.org/2020/02/26/Decred-2019-Marketing-Report/) on the Decred blog detailing all project marketing related expenses from last year. The report includes an examination of what worked and what didn't, as well as prescriptions for next year. The three high level recommendations include: imagine what can be achieved socially using the Decred technology stack, break the bubble to expand Decred beyond those currently in crypto, and leveraging the power of every individual within the community. The report calls for a decentralization of marketing efforts by geography. To that end, Latin America has already passed a proposal. The European proposal was made, but failed. It is expected that proposals for Brazil, the United States and Canada, Australia, and Europe will be made in March.

Monde PR came on board and quickly established project public relations goals, target audiences, key messages, established credibility bullet points, documented key topics, performed a competitor analysis, documented all spokespeople, created key stories to pitch, and even began outreach, yielding a number of valuable placements.

Decred in Depth released two episodes in February. The first featured Ammar Naseer, titled [Decred, an economic breakthrough](https://decredindepth.libsyn.com/ammar-nasier-decred-an-economic-breakthrough), and the second featuring Elian Huesca was titled, [DCR in LATAM](https://decredindepth.libsyn.com/elian-huesca-dcr-in-latam). Additionally, @Mr. Black worked with @checkmatey_ and @permabullnino_ to release a new, trading-focused podcast titled "[Rough Consensus](https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cDovL2RlY3JlZGluZGVwdGgubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M&episode=OWQ1MmU3ZWMtMjUzYy00MzU0LThlYzktZmUyYjU5MzI2YjUx&hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwiVouvaoIHoAhXNK80KHZFiC0sQieUEegQICxAE&ep=6)."

On February 18th, DCR Comic released a comic featuring [The Lightning Network](https://twitter.com/DCRComic/status/1229792848188444672?s=20). All of their work can be viewed on their [website](https://dcrcomic.org/).

Checkmatey_ published an extremely interesting piece titled, [Observing Ethereum Governance during the ProgPoW Debate](https://medium.com/@_Checkmatey_/observing-ethereum-governance-during-the-progpow-debate-9bf1aec724ad). This article describes the shortcomings of Ethereum's governance system and how Decred's tools and methodologies can be employed to solve them. It is an excellent example of inserting Decred's points of differentiation into wider conversations, and was [well-received by many in the Ethereum community, including David Hoffman](https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1234653059424358400?s=20), co-host of the POV Crypto podcast.
