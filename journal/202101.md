## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

January's updates to dcrd are a good example what users building [from source](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c) can get today without waiting for the next release.

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

The main effort of the month was to prepare, thoroughly review and test several epic changes towards [multi-peer](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1145) block downloading, although the changes are generally useful for simplifying the code and unlocking future optimizations:

- completely [reworked](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2518) block indexing and processing to use headers-first semantics and support out of order processing of block data
- reworked UTXO handling to work on a [per-outpoint](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2540) basis instead of at a transaction level
- [sync model](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2555) reworked to use header announcements. The small 180-byte [headers](https://devdocs.decred.org/developer-guides/block-header-specifications/) will be downloaded before any block data, and then only needed blocks will be downloaded. This optimizes traffic, removes the concept of "orphan blocks", and opens the door for future enhancements.
- preparations for implementing UTXO cache

Other changes:

- finalized [DCP-0006](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0006/dcp-0006.mediawiki) document describing technical details of the upcoming Decentralized Treasury consensus change
- added 3 new HTTPS [seeders](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2532) to reduce dependency on decred.org domain
- the deprecated version 1 cfilters were [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2525) in favor of the more efficient v2 ("compact filters" power Decred's awesome [SPV](https://docs.decred.org/wallets/spv/) tech for light clients)
- added TLS client [authentication](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2482) using client certificates (more flexible than user+password)
- added [RSA](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2551) 4096 bit key support to gencerts tool
- new commands to [invalidate](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2536) arbitrary blocks and reconsider arbitrary blocks for validation (allows easier testing and smoother upgrades in the future)
- prevent [duplicate](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2563) pending connections to same IP address and port
- miscellaneous updates to test code, logging, docs, dependencies, minor fixes, etc

A total of 47 PRs from 10 contributors were [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2021-01-01..2021-01-31+sort%3Aupdated-asc), adding 12K and deleting 7K lines of code.

In progress:

- introduce [Age-Partitioned Bloom Filters](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2579) to significantly reduce memory used for tracking what data other peers are known to have

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

- VSP client was [rewritten](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1956) to improve background processing and support recovery of fee payment information after seed restores { better translation to User-English is welcome, I didn't quite grasp the first design goal of 1956 }
- narrow [rules](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1961) of what is considered a possible CoinJoin (used when detecting wallet's mixed account during recovery from seed)

The above changes were also backported to v1.6 release.

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

- new page showing a list of [unspent](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3098) outputs (UTXOs)
- show VSPs in [random](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3114) order
- update [ticket status](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3121) on starts, restarts and seed restores
- remove usage of [CSRF](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3133) tokens when communicating to Politeia, to prevent privacy leaks
- [auto-detect](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3033) if the wallet used mixing in the past
- UI hints for [RFP](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3118) proposals and submissions
- updated translations
- a few updates to Trezor support
- more automated [UI tests](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2659)
- ~24 bug fixes and 3 UI tweaks

Most of the above changes were included in v1.6 release and the rest will land in v1.6.1 patch release.

**[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia)**

- show basic [proposal rules](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2290) before the Submit button
- remove calls to [dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1360) from politeiavoter command-line tool
- UI for setting up and verifying [TOTP](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2127) codes for 2FA

CMS:

- improved proposal [billing](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2275) summary
- improved [code stats](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2279) display
- bug fixes

{ tlog update would be nice }

**[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd)**

- make sending of ticket's [parent](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/218) transaction mandatory as it greatly reduces the chance of ticket broadcast errors
- update dependencies

vspd [version 1.0.0](https://github.com/decred/vspd/releases/tag/release-v1.0.0) is now tagged and all VSP operators should upgrade their mainnet deployment.

v1.0.0 marks the beginning of a proper release process, where VSP operators should only ever run tagged releases in production (until now, vspd has still been in dev and operators have just been deploying whatever was latest master).

**[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool)**

- various improvements for config handling, errors, and HTTP redirects

In progress:

- support for [reverse proxy](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/301) deployments
- NiceHash support

**[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd)**

- shutdown fixes and dependency updates

**[dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex)**

Three key topics in January were to fix remaining issues for the [v0.1.4](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.1.4) patch (which was part of the collective v1.6 release), continue development towards the next v0.2 milestone, and manage the proposal for the next development phase.

Merged work:

- allow the user to [export and import](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/885) account data (mainly private keys)
- support [switching](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/901) from unencrypted to an encrypted BTC wallet
- client-side fee rate [limits](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/874)
- sample [config](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/927) files
- validate max [fee rate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/898) at match time to partially prevent the server from maliciously assigning too high fee
- fixed several issues with address validation, wallet locking, login, etc, and backported them to v0.1.4 release

A total of 32 PRs from 7 contributors were [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2021-01-01..2021-01-31+sort%3Aupdated-asc), adding 3K and deleting 1K lines of code.

Check the [second](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d462ac3) proposal for a big picture plan of what's coming in the next 9 months. And congratulations to DCRDEX team with the stunning 98% Yes votes!

**[dcrandroid](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrandroid)**

- initial CoinShuffle++ [mixing](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrandroid/pull/520) support: when enabled, generating receiving addresses for the mixed account and sending funds from the change account are disabled
- Privacy [UI pages](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrandroid/pull/529): introduction, help popup, display of unmixed balance, CSPP server details, mixing progress, etc
- Politeia [proposals](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrandroid/pull/503) support: see a list of proposals and their vote status, open a specific proposal and receive notifications on new proposals, vote start and finish
- debug page to view details about connected [peers](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrandroid/pull/501)
- option to create a [watch-only](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrandroid/pull/530) wallet from the splash screen
- more specific notifications for [ticket](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrandroid/pull/531) vote and revocation transactions

To enable the above features, mixing and Politeia support were added to the [dcrlibwallet](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrlibwallet) base library and can now be reused by dcrios and godcr.

**[dcrios](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrios)**

## Governance

In January the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 11,878 DCR and spent 6,750 DCR. Using January's daily average DCR/USD rate of $54.25, this is $644K received and $366K spent. At December's average daily rate of $31.07, the USD figure billed for past work is $210K. As of Feb 4, Treasury balance is 645,642 DCR (51.6 million USD at $80.00).

Four proposals were submitted in January, with {insert latest status at publication}. 

- DCRDEX Phase 2 development [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d462ac3) set new records in terms of support from the ticket pool, with 53% of the eligible tickets turning out to vote almost unanimously yes (98.2%)! This proposal approved a budget of $245,000 to develop a set of features including support for SPV wallets, ETH/ERC-20 token trading, Bitcoin forks and Decrediton integration.
- Decred in Depth is going to be under new management, and doing it live, after a [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/391108e) from @elima_iii was approved with 86.3% approval and 28% turnout - this covers 24-36 episodes at $500/episode.
- A new research proposal from @ammarooni requests $17,500 to write and publish a book, [Decentralized Credits: The Digitization of Money and State](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/9e1d644).
- The Decred Arabia team [requested](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d0c32d5) $6,200 for six months' funding. 

A further two proposals were submitted in early February, for [Decred Journal 2021](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/1d74b88) (max budget $39,000) and [Open Source Research 2021](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/020b8b0) (max budget $40,000). The Decred Journal proposal offers an opportunity to leave more formal and immutable feedback than usual, and you can also (if you've got tickets) vote to continue funding the Journal!

Politeia Digest returned with a catch-up [issue 40](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue040/) which also covered December proposals.

## Network

{ section hint:

Staking: [30-day average](https://dcrstats.com/) ticket price was 173.23 DCR (+9.33). The [price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=kjc4h4yd-kkn4o887&scale=linear&bin=window&axis=time&visibility=true-false) varied between 149.9-212.28 DCR. [Locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=kjc6mqhk-kkn6yv2e&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time&visibility=true-false) was 6.54-7.12 million DCR, which corresponded to 52.52-56.64% of the available supply [participating](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=kjc6rs1v-kkn73zz0&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time&visibility=true-false) in PoS.

We once again had record high numbers this month both in terms of ticket price 212.28 DCR and also stake participation 56.64%

Microblogging service Parler has tested a new level of censorship in January. Taking down of apps from Google and Apple stores was not surprising, but a quick deplatforming from third party 2FA/identity/database services and ultimately Amazon Web Services showed pretty much everything that can go wrong when centralized solutions are naively used to build a less censored environment. Hopefully developers and node operators can learn from this and prepare for such events in advance.

Good news for censorship fighters, the [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) repository that was taken down via RIAA's request, was restored after an impressive [push back](https://torrentfreak.com/riaas-youtube-dl-takedown-ticks-of-developers-and-githubs-ceo-201027/) involving creative ways to share censored code.
