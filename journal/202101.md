## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

January's upgrades of dcrd { others? } are a good example what users building [from source](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c) can consume _today_ without waiting months for the next release!

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

The main effort of the month was to prepare, thoroughly review and test several epic changes towards [multi-peer](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1145) block downloading, although the changes are generally useful for simplifying the code and unlocking future optimizations:

- completely [reworked](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2518) block indexing and processing to use headers-first semantics and support out of order processing
- reworked UTXO handling to work on a per-[outpoint](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2540) basis instead of at a transaction level
- [sync model](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2555) reworked to use header announcements. The small 180-byte [headers](https://devdocs.decred.org/developer-guides/block-header-specifications/) will be downloaded before any block data, and then only needed blocks will be downloaded. This optimizes traffic, removes the concept of "orphan blocks", and opens the door for future enhancements.
- preparations for implementing UTXO cache

Other changes:

- added 3 new HTTPS [seeders](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2532) to reduce dependency on decred.org domain
- the deprecated version 1 cfilters were [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2525) in favor of the more efficient v2 ("compact filters" power Decred's awesome [SPV](https://docs.decred.org/wallets/spv/) tech for light clients)
- support TLS client [authentication](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2482) using client certificates (more flexible than user+password)
- support for [RSA](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2551) 4096 bit keys in gencerts tool
- new commands to [invalidate](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2536) arbitrary blocks and reconsider arbitrary blocks for validation (allows easier testing and smoother upgrades in the future)
- prevent [duplicate](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2563) pending connections to same IP address and port
- miscellaneous updates to test code, logging, docs, dependencies, minor fixes, etc

A total of 47 PRs from 10 contributors were [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2021-01-01..2021-01-31+sort%3Aupdated-asc), adding 12K and deleting 7K lines of code.

In progress:

- introduce [Age-Partitioned Bloom Filters](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2579) to significantly reduce memory used for tracking what data other peers are known to have

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

- VSP client was [rewritten](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1956) to improve background processing and support recovery of fee payment information after seed restores { better translation to User-English welcome, I didn't quite grasp the first design goal of 1956 }
- narrow [rules](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1961) of what is considered a possible CoinJoin { I got what this change does but now where it is used }

The above changes were also backported to v1.6 release.

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

- added list of [unspent](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3098) outputs (UTXOs)
- update [ticket status](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3121) on starts, restarts and seed restores
- show VSPs in [random](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3114) order
- remove usage of [CSRF](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3133) tokens when communicating to Politeia, to prevent privacy leaks
- [auto-detect](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3033) if the wallet used mixing in the past
- UI hints for [RFP](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3118) proposals and submissions
- updated translations
- a few updates to Trezor support
- more automated [UI tests](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2659)
- ~24 bug fixes and 3 UI tweaks

Most of the above changes were included in v1.6 release.

**[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia)**

Politeia:

- show basic [proposal rules](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2290) before the Submit button
- remove calls to [dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1360) from politeiavoter command-line tool
- UI for setting up and verifying [TOTP](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2127) codes for 2FA

CMS:

- improved proposal [billing](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2275) summary
- improved [code stats](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2279) display
- bug fixes

{ tlog update would be nice }

**[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd)**

- make sending of ticket's [parent](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/218) transaction mandatory as it greatly reduces the chance of ticket broadcast errors
- update dependencies

**[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool)**

- various improvements for config handling, errors, HTTP redirects

**[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd)**

**[dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex)**

Three key topics for January were to fix remaining issues for the [v0.1.4](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.1.4) patch (which was part of the collective v1.6 release), continue development towards the next v0.2 milestone, and manage the proposal for the next development phase.

Merged work:

- allow the user to [export and import](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/885) account data (primarily private keys)
- support [switching](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/901) from unencrypted to an encrypted BTC wallet
- client-side fee rate [limit](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/874)
- created sample [config](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/927) files
- validate max [fee rate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/898) at match time to partially prevent the server from maliciously assigning too high fee
- fixed several issues with address validation, wallet locking, login, etc, and backported them to v0.1.4 release

A total of 32 PRs from 7 contributors were [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2021-01-01..2021-01-31+sort%3Aupdated-asc), adding 3K and deleting 1K lines of code.

Check the [second](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d462ac3) proposal for a big picture plan of what's coming in the next 9 months. And congratulations to DCRDEX team with the stunning 98% Yes votes!

**[dcrandroid](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrandroid)**

- CoinShuffle++ [mixing](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrandroid/pull/520) support. When enabled, generating receiving addresses for the mixed account and sending funds from the change account are disabled.
- privacy [UI pages](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrandroid/pull/529): introduction, help popup, display of unmixed balance, CSPP server details, mixing progress, etc
- Politeia [proposals](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrandroid/pull/503) support. Allows to list proposals, see their vote status, view a specific proposal and receive notifications on new proposals, vote start and finish.
- debug page to view details about connected [peers](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrandroid/pull/501)
- option to create a [watch-only](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrandroid/pull/530) wallet from the splash screen
- more specific notifications for [ticket](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrandroid/pull/531) vote and revocation transactions

To enable the above features, mixing and Politeia support were added to the [dcrlibwallet](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrlibwallet) base library and can be reused by dcrios and godcr.

## Network

{ section hint:

- check dcrdata.org (preferred), dcrstats.com and charts.dcr.farm to get the numbers
- use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

Hashrate: January's [hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=t1-t2&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month. Pool hashrate [distribution](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) as of {date}: {pool name n%, ...}.

{ hint: fallback link for pool distribution: https://dcrstats.com/pow }

Staking: [30-day average](https://dcrstats.com/) ticket price was {n.d, try to snapshot it on 1st} DCR (+{n.d}). The [price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=t1-t2&bin=window&axis=time&visibility=true-false&mode=stepped) {set zoom to show the month} varied between {n.d}-{n.d} DCR. [Locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=t1-t2&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was {n.dd}-{n.dd} million DCR, which corresponded to {n.d}-{n.d}% of the available supply [participating](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=t1-t2&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in PoS.

American miner Marathon Patent Group joined DMG Blockchain Solutions to [create](https://www.marathonpg.com/news/press-releases/detail/1220/marathon-patent-group-and-dmg-blockchain-solutions-to-form) a "cooperative mining pool". To benefit the industry, the pool will include "clean block mining" proprietary tech that will "specifically omit any transactions deemed risky by Walletscore, and which may not meet OFAC standards". r/Bitcoin [discussed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kqyg0l/a_2nd_american_miner_marathon_patent_group_is/) possible countermeasures and claims made by the companies.

Microblogging service Parler has tested a new level of censorship in January. Taking down of apps from Google and Apple stores was not surprising, but a quick deplatforming from third party 2FA/identity/database services and ultimately Amazon Web Services showed pretty much everything that can go wrong when centralized solutions are naively used to build a less censored environment. Hopefully developers and node operators can learn from this and prepare for such events in advance.

Good news for censorship fighters, the [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) repository that was taken down via RIAA's request, was restored after an impressive [push back](https://torrentfreak.com/riaas-youtube-dl-takedown-ticks-of-developers-and-githubs-ceo-201027/) involving creative ways to share censored code.
