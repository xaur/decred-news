## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{ hint: add below overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warrants a paragraph, drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans }

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

Merged in master and the upcoming v1.6.2 release:

- only send [fast block](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2606) announcements to full node peers, and don't send them to lightweight clients that cannot properly handle them. This significantly improves dcrwallet's SPV operation. { how much better? }

Main addition of the month is the new package for handling [standard addresses](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2610) that is easier to follow and use than the code it replaces. It is also more generic, allowing to add new address types in the future. If you have ever wondered how "scripts" and "addresses" are related, or how "standard" is different from "consensus", check the shiny new [README](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/master/txscript/stdaddr) of the package or follow its examples and comprehensive tests to fully understand how it works. Thanks to all reviewers and newcomers for sharing how it looks to the fresh eyes!

Other merged work:

- option to not print [timestamps](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2608) in logs
- more accurate detection of [own IP](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2571) address to fix some UPnP configurations
- increased test coverage for rpcserver and the new UTXO cache

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

Merged in master and the upcoming v1.6.2 release:

- prevent [low-fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2011) submissions to the mixing server, which are now being rejected
- fixed [UTXO handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2013) to avoid confusing "insufficient balance" errors when the remaining balance allows to buy one ticket
- config flag to disable [logging](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2014) to files
- update [vote choices](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2016) for vspd tickets using the `setvotechoices` command, if the VSP is configured in dcrwallet settings
- new `accountunlocked` [command](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2020) reporting account encryption and locked status (needed for dcrdex but is also useful on its own)

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

Patch release v1.6.2 is being [prepared](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/commits/release-v1.6) to fix several bugs and update the Decred-patched [trezor-connect](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3340) library.

Merged in master:

- use the new [slider](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3046) component from pi-ui
- reorganized [balances](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3319) overview
- List UTXO's view converted to a [modal](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3323)
- improved layout of [Trezor](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2956)-related modals
- project updated to latest [Electron 12](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3318) and [Webpack 5](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3322)
- ~25 pull requests concluded the 1-year quest to migrate the codebase to a modern React programming style with functional [components](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2438), hooks, and [CSS modules](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2439)
- increased UI test coverage
- ~11 bug fixes

A total of 53 PRs from 5 contributors were [merged](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2021-03-01..2021-03-31+sort%3Aupdated-asc), changing 504 files, adding 14.5K and deleting 14.7K lines of code. Without many user-tangible changes, these large numbers basically mean a lot of "behind-the-scenes" infrastructure upgrades to make future development easier.

In progress: [DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3356) integration and design updates.

**[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia)**

An epic migration to a more scalable and [flexible](https://twitter.com/lukebp_/status/1376238020563767303) storage backend is [merged](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1180) after almost 1 year of development. On a high level it brings us the following:

- scalability - it is no longer constrained to the file system of a single instance
- timestamping and actual data are separated, allowing to truly censor (and delete) data without awkward trade-offs (mind that censoring only removes data but not the record proving that the server has seen it, i.e. the "audit trail" is immutable { correct? })
- ability to retrieve a cryptographic timestamped proof for any piece of data, e.g. a single comment (there was no easy way to do this in the Git backend)
- simplified `politeiad` API
- plugin architecture where plugins can extend generic timestamped "records" with additional functionality, such as comments or ticket voting. Plugins can be turned on and off in a config file without writing code.
- `politeiawww` API rewritten to be generic and application agnostic while plugins handle specialized routes

It rewrites much of the politeia codebase as can be seen from the stats: 47K lines added, 40K deleted, 345 files changed in 496 commits.

{ check readmes and pigui }

Other changes:

- trickling mode of the politeiavoter command-line tool was made truly [random](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1368) instead of using random bucketized durations

**[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool)**

Release candidate 2 for the upcoming v1.2.0 is [out](https://twitter.com/dnldd/status/1376476239062564868) for testing. For a full list of breaking changes, bug fixes and improvements see the [release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/releases/tag/v1.2.0-rc2).

Merged in master:

- fixed saving of [archived](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/309) payments
- disable account [lookup](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/310) UI in solo pools where it is not available
- `--homedir` config flag renamed to `--appdata` to be consistent with other software

**[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd)**

@matheusd discovered an interesting hack that allows to implement PTLCs with very little changes to existing LN code built for HTLCs.

PTLCs (Point-Time-Locked-Contracts) is an exciting development in the Lightning Network space for its potential to address the [limitations](https://suredbits.com/payment-points-monotone-access-structures/) of the currently-used HTLCs (Hashed Time-Locked Contracts) and offer new use cases.

The hack to enable PTLCs was so simple _for @matheusd_ that he was able to build an interesting construct called Multi-Redeemer Transaction Tree (MRTTREE) with it, and an offline LN donation/payment prototype on top of that. The system is made of a patched [dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/compare/v0.3.1...matheusd:ptlc-poc), a PoC [server](https://github.com/matheusd/mrttree) to coordinate MRTTREEs, and a patched [Decrediton](https://github.com/matheusd/decrediton/commits/mrttree_poc). The math is explained in an [email](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2021-March/002983.html) to the lightning-dev mailing list and a presentation [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1sQGHUKU7I) (offline LN payments demo starts around [15 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1sQGHUKU7I&t=915s) mark).

The hack is experimental and needs some serious cryptographic look to make sure it is safe.

This work is interesting in the context of LN-powered [multi-owner tickets](https://blog.decred.org/2019/11/11/LN-Multi-Owner-Tickets/) (a better form of ticket splitting), but also for other use cases like off-chain donations and crowdfunding.

{ how this PTLC-based MRTTREE is different from a HTLC-based one described in the early blogs? }

You can learn more about Decred's LN in the recent Decred in Depth with @matheusd, starting at [28 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6oIrRsZnMQ&t=27m54s) mark.

**[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp)**

- minimum [peer count](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/64) made configurable for servers that want to increase it to provide higher quality mixes
- support [LOGFLAGS](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/66) for more flexible logging

**[dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex)**

- ability to reset and change the [password](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/978)
- ability to [disable](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/985) account
- allow [sorting](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/955) Your Orders table
- indicate [disconnected](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/989) state
- support account-based [encryption](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1023) and locking for Decred (this will be used by Decrediton to only lock the trading account but not others)
- allow multiple authenticated [sessions](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1012) (to login in different browsers at the same time)
- send most recent [fee rate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1000) estimate to the client to support SPV clients, improve order estimates and tighten up security
- Ethereum simnet [harness](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/956) for testing during development
- foundations for [Bitcoin Cash](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/944) support
- send raw [transaction](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/804) data to accomodate SPV clients who don't have a mempool and are in the dark until a contract's tx is mined (this also makes the process more robust against poor propagation of tx on the network)
- added database [versioning](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/959) and generated historical trading data (volumes, highs and lows, etc)
- updated to use [Webpack 5](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/990) and other newer modules

A total of 25 PRs from 6 contributors were [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2021-03-01..2021-03-31+sort%3Aupdated-asc), adding 22K and deleting 9K lines of code.

In progress: Ethereum support, a new [registration](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1017) protocol (more robust + supports fee payments in arbitrary assets), demo [Electron](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/999) integration, and multiple other improvements.

Feedback from Ethereum experts on the [swap contracts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1001) used is greatly appreciated.

See the [v0.2](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/milestone/6) and [v0.3](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/milestone/12) milestones to track progress of next releases.

## Network

{ section hint: use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

**Hashrate**: March's [hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month.

Pool hashrate [distribution](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) as of {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

Distribution of 1,000 blocks [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) before {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

{ hint: fallback link for pool distribution: https://dcrstats.com/pow }

Hashrate of the previously top UUPool appears to have migrated to Antpool and F2Pool.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom={t1}-{t2}&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between {n.n}-{n.n} DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at 177.8 DCR (+{n.n}). { use same t1-t2 for zoom }

The [locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, meaning that {n.n}-{n.n}% of the circulating supply [participated](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.

{ recap of ticket price action if it was interesting }

**Nodes**: Throughout March there were around {n} reachable nodes according to [dcrextdata](https://dcrextdata.planetdecred.org/nodes). Version distribution: {n% app version, ...}.

yes!

- 386 shot somewhere please
- is there an API?
- is code open?

{ maybe } The share of [mixed coins](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true-true-true) varied between {n.n}-{n.n}%.

Decred's [Lightning Network](https://ln-map.jholdstock.uk/) has seen 34 nodes (+4), 60 channels (+4) with a total capacity of 20 DCR (+3.2), as of Apr 1.

Ethereum's ProgPoW tensions have found an [expression](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1366831390424068098) in miners' hashrate which signals 61% opposition and only 14% support as of Feb.

{ interesting claims in comments, [this](https://twitter.com/iamDCinvestor/status/1366746473535332360) says such signaling is unreliable and [this](https://twitter.com/Tetranode/status/1366818706706165762) predicts a scenario involving DeFi and claims that MakerDAO and AAVE back EIP-1559. I don't have context to understand, we can move this to Mar to cover all that if its interesting }
