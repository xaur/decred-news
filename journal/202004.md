## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

- `schnorr`: improvements to safety, testing, and performance, as well as a comprehensive [README](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/dcrec/secp256k1/schnorr/README.md) describing the custom Schnorr-based signature scheme used in Decred
- more parts of the codebase migrated from Go's standard big integers to specialized field types, making significant performance improvements

While the consensus supports Schnorr signatures, the rest of the infrastructure needed to really take advantage of their benefits is not well fleshed out and therefore they are essentially not in widespread use yet. The goal is to remedy that.

Lots of optimizations in dcrd made over the past months have led to a "suffering from success" [meme](https://twitter.com/degeri_crypto/status/1248522626210897921): older nodes now think the new version is requesting too much data too quickly and [banning](https://matrix.to/#/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$158650272611269MJQhM:decred.org) it. The "banning rate" parameters will have to be adjusted to reflect the new speeds.

{ any perf numbers to present are welcome, like % changes, IBD times, etc }

The dcrd repository is no longer configured as a fork of [btcd](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd). So many new features have been added and overall improvements made that there is very little code still in common between them. Also, one of the primary reasons for having a fork is to be able to pull in upstream changes easily. That really is not the case anymore though because the code is so different that any changes desired for dcrd would effectively have to be ported anyway. And even then, most changes made in btcd simply don't apply to dcrd anymore. The "unforking" also removes the confusion about the fork count where dcrd page showed the number of all forks of btcd (1,500+). Now it shows 235 forks for dcrd, while btcd has 1,290. Finally, it removes the annoyance and a chance for error where pressing "New pull request" would open a PR against the upstream btcd repository with all the changes on Decred's master branch.

The `dcrctl` command-line app that controls dcrd and dcrwallet was split out of dcrd into its own [repository](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl) to address dependency and maintenance [issues](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2133).

In progress:

- Decentralize Treasury Spending [development](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2170) work was published to make it more visible and let more people join the discussion. The work is based on the [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f) but adds significant changes to the spec. { it mentions changes to the spec, is that spec available anywhere? rr: I think it's referring to the proposal as providing a spec of sorts }

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

- new [`addtransaction`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1712) command that will be particularly useful for the upcoming ticket-based VSP design
- bug fixes and code maintenance

dcrwallet is no longer a fork of [btcwallet](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcwallet) for the same reasons as dcrd, and has 137 of its own forks as of writing.

In progress:

- Decentralized Treasury Spending [support](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1714) for the wallet corresponding to the work in dcrd.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton):

- [first](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2448) [steps](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2449) to migrate to functional components (a newer [approach](https://programmingwithmosh.com/react/react-functional-components/) in the React framework - they are easier to reason about and test)
- new action to [abandon transaction](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2467) that are not being mined or got "stuck"
- [started](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2457) reusing the pi-ui library for several components in order to have consistent look & feel across Decred's different products
- first [steps](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2452) towards [CSPP support](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2455) { any rough estimate how much % is ready for CSPP? }

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia):

- new [method](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1137) to query line items that have been billed to the given proposal
- [separated](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1175) metadata out of Politeia proposals and CMS invoices - this removes a hacky way to store proposal title that was used previously and allows to add arbitrary metadata, including the fields required by the RFP proposals
- part of the work to allow viewing Politeia [without javascript](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1833)
- normalized and added [caching](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1844) for paywall data

## Governance

In April the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 13,250 DCR and spent 17,228 DCR. Using April's daily average DCR/USD rate of $12.34, this is $164K received and $213K spent. At March's average daily rate of $13.40, the USD figure billed for work completed in that month is $231K. As of May 3, Treasury balance is 636,000 DCR (9.17 million USD at $14.42).

Two new proposals were submitted in April, [one](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/bce7bf3cd1f74d571d23ac8a330ddf29a14a547ed0cc9c995f1a97dce733d1e1) for a billboard marketing campaign was rejected with 17% approval (31% turnout) and [another](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/83b59ef5ab40193a86073abbd93cea13ed6d071eecc78918ab5cf98cba7c7a67) from CryptoNoticias for a content marketing campaign was also rejected with 31% approval and 30% turnout.

The two proposals from March voted on this month were also rejected. [DCR Comic 2](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2f08f8518bc7672069a10ac6461fd9ab341d4a9e4c343fd4a7ec426250f3896f) had support from 49.4% of the tickets that voted (participation of 19%), while the [Decred Daily](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/7d42c6f4bf3059b64789185af615c1df97cb61a379425933be5ff01d074ed4d5) proposal had 44% approval from the 17% of eligible tickets that voted. Both did not reach the quorum of 20% votes.

For more detail on these see [issue 30](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue030/) of Politeia Digest.

## Network

Hashrate: [April's hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=k8f3rvwm-k9oqhibz&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~302 Ph/s and closed ~360 Ph/s, bottoming at 240 Ph/s and peaking at 470 Ph/s throughout the month. Pool [hashrate distribution](https://dcrstats.com/pow) as of May 1: UUPool 46%, Poolin 22%, lab.antpool.com 17%, F2Pool 2%, Luxor 2%, BTC.com 1.6%, BeePool 0.12%, CoinMine 0.05%, Suprnova 0.02% and others ~9%. Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Staking: [30-day average](https://dcrstats.com/) ticket price was 137.8 DCR (-4.1). The [price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=k8f3rvwm-k9oqhibz&bin=window&axis=time&visibility=true-false&mode=stepped) varied between 131.7-142.8 DCR. [Locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=k8f3rvwm-k9oqhibz&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was 5.62-5.71 million DCR, which corresponded to 49.2-50.3% of the available supply [participating](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=k8f3rvwm-k9oqhibz&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in PoS.

Nodes: Throughout [April](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=1585699200000&to=1588291200000) there was an average of 131 public listening nodes and 206 total nodes per dcr.farm. Average version distribution for Apr: 44% dcrd v1.5.1, 16% dcrd v1.5, 6% dcrd v1.6 dev builds, 5% dcrd v1.5 dev and RC builds, 4% dcrd v1.4, 9% dcrwallet v1.5.1, 2.4% dcrwallet v1.4, 1.4% dcrwallet v1.5.

Updates from @Checkmate:

- Decred section of the [Our Network](https://ournetwork.substack.com/p/our-network-issue-15) newsletter ([tweet](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1247649984473894912)). Multiple metrics based on @Checkmate's Stock-to-Flow model, PoW miner income, and @permabullnino's ticket data research, signal that the network is undervalued.
- Substantial on-chain volume relative to network valuation, [NVT and RVT](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1252754120345182210) metrics.
- Increasing [transaction volumes](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1255084712386654209) due to increased privacy usage.

## Integrations

[dcr.blue](https://dcr.blue/) VSP announced that it will shut down in a message sent to all users with verified email on Apr 20. It was [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pull/97) from the [listing](https://www.decred.org/vsp/) and Decrediton but will stay online for the rest of 2020. Since the maximum lifetime of a ticket is roughly 4.7 months, this gives users around 3 months to stop buying tickets assigned to DCR.Blue. Users are advised to backup their redeem scripts if they haven't already (a copy is available in the VSP account), and start buying tickets to a different VSP. Please avoid picking too large VSPs to maintain a healthy distribution and better security for the network. This is the first VSP to attempt a "graceful shutdown" rather than just disappearing without notice as some other VSPs have done in the past.

[decred.raqamiya.net](https://decred.raqamiya.net/) VSP that was [delisted](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pull/95) in March is now again operational and was [added back](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pull/96) to the listing. As of writing, it holds about 330 live tickets (0.8%), has 4 servers and features a custom UI.

Metal Pay [added](https://twitter.com/metalpaysme/status/1249745420206686208) [support](https://blog.metalpay.com/metal-pay-welcomes-decred/) for DCR on their marketplace. It provides another fiat onramp and works in most US states. They followed the announcement with [tweets](https://twitter.com/metalpaysme/status/1250424090172612615) about Decred.

[Transak](https://global.transak.com/) [announced](https://twitter.com/transak_finance/status/1256654711412776961) that trading DCR against EUR, GBP and INR is [available](https://global.transak.com/?defaultCryptoCurrency=DCR) on their exchange. USD pairs are coming soon.

An instant exchange [SwapSpace](https://swapspace.co/) [added](https://twitter.com/SwapSpaceCo/status/1250078395884539906) support for Decred.

[Steelbackup](https://steelbackup.com/), a physical seed backup solution added a new product and also [answered](https://twitter.com/steelbackup/status/1248058631523905538) some questions on how it works and the difference between its products. 
 Currently, there are two types of products, [laser engraved] (https://steelbackup.com/product/decred-laser-engraved/),  and [laser marked] (https://steelbackup.com/product/decred-laser-marked/), the engraved one is the most robust solution as steel is removed which makes the marking grid as permanent as the steel. The laser marked product is marked with Molybdenum Disulfide solution which makes it scratch, acids, and high temperature (up to 650 degrees F) resistant. The products are designed to be simple with no moving parts, users just need a center punch (found at a local hardware store) to indent their seed. SteelBackup launched in Feb 2020 and ships worldwide.

[Another](https://www.coindesk.com/dforce-hacker-returns-almost-all-of-stolen-25m-in-crypto) DeFi attack occurred, although this time dForce got most of its lost $25 million back from the attacker and users are being reimbursed. 

On the more obscure stablecoin network [PegNet](https://www.coindesk.com/miners-trick-stablecoin-protocol-pegnet-turning-11-into-almost-7m-hoard), rogue miners turned a $11 pJYP balance into a 6.7 million pUSD balance by manipulating price oracles with a form of 51% attack. The attackers were unable to liquidate more than a small proportion of the pUSD, and have subsequently reached out to say they were just trying to pen test the network, and have burned the magically created pUSD.

People are [wondering](https://twitter.com/econoar/status/1254063336779444226) why ProgPoW is back on the Ethereum Core devs agenda, and whether the inability to shake it off means there is something [rotten](https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1254065039105024001) in Ethereum's governance.
