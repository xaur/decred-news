Pool [hashrate distribution](https://dcrstats.com/pow) as of {date}: {pool name n%, ...}. Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

[Locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=k73pwcch-k8jayo3s&bin=block&axis=time) was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, which corresponded to {n.n}-{n.n}% of the available supply [participating](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=k73pwcch-k8jayo3s&bin=block&axis=time) in PoS.
