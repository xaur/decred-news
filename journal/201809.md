# {DRAFT} Decred Journal – {MONTH} {YEAR} {DRAFT}

![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover text}")

## Development

Final version 1.3.0 of core software was released! Changes are the same as reported in the [previous issue](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/201808) for the RC1 version, plus some bugfixes that landed in RC2 and the 1.3.0 final. Read the full release notes and grab the downloads [on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.0). As always, don't forget to verify signatures.

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): completed several steps towards [multipeer downloads](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1145), [improved](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1447) introduction to the software in the main [README](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/README.md), continued porting cleanups and refactoring from upstream [btcd](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd).

Currently in review are [initial release](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1434) of smart [fee estimator](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1412) and a change to [UTXO set semantics](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1471). The latter is a large and important change that provides simpler handling, and resolves various issues with the previous approach. A lot of testing and careful review is needed so any help is welcome.

Educational series for new Decred developers by @matheusd added two episodes: [02 Simnet Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGbsU2PjpLM) shows how to automate simnet management with tmux and [03 Miner Reward Invalidation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECB8vDzOd1M) explains block validity rules.

Finally, a [pull request template](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md) with a list of checks was added to help guide the contributors to dcrd.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): bugfixes and RPC improvements to support desktop and mobile wallets.

Developers are welcome to comment on [this idea](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/issues/1217) to derive stakepool keys from the HD wallet seed. This would eliminate the need to backup and restore redeem scripts, thus greatly improving wallet UX. (missed in July issue)

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): bugfixes, refactoring to make the sync process more robust, new [loading animations](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1612), design polishing.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): multiple [improvements](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/472) to the CLI client (security conscious users with more funds at risk might prefer CLI), security hardening. A [feature](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/479) to deprecate or timeout proposals was identified as necessary for initial release and the work started. Privacy enhancement to not leak metadata of ticket holders ([issue](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/486), [PR](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/487)).

[Android](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): update from @collins: "Second test release for dcrandroid is out. Major bugs have been fixed since last test. Latest code from SPV sync has been integrated. Once again, bug reports are welcome and issues can be opened [on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues)". Ask in #dev room about the APK for testing.

Overall the app is quite stable and accepting more testers. A new security page was added that allows to validate addresses and to sign/verify messages, similar to Decrediton's Security Center. Work on translations is beginning.

[iOS](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): the app started accepting testers last week. @macsleven: "the test version of Decred Wallet for iOS is available, we have a link for installing the app but the builds currently require your UDID. Contact either @macsleven or @raedah with your UDID if you would like to help test."

Both mobile apps received new desigh themes.

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): v3.0 was released for mainnet! Highlights: [charts](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts), "merged debits" view, [agendas](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/agendas) page, Insight API support, side chain tracking, Go 1.11 support with module builds, numerous backend improvements. Full release notes [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/releases/tag/v3.0.0). [9 contributors](https://twitter.com/chappjc/status/1039172760143060994) made it happen. Project lead @chappjc [notes](https://twitter.com/chappjc/status/1039173243452772353): "This collaboration with @raedahgroup on our own block explorer and web API for @decredproject has been super productive."

Trezor: proof of concept implementation for Trezor Model T firmware is [in the works](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-core/pull/358) (previous work was for Model One).

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): update to use Go modules, simnet support and several fixes.

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): beginner's guide [overhaul](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/587), multiple fixes and cleanups.

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb): added 3rd party wallets, removed inactive PoW pools, removed web wallet and multiple fixes.

@Richard-Red is collecting all Decred-related GitHub repositories in this [curated list](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/decred-on-github)

Welcome to new people contributing for the first time: @klebe, @s_ben, @victorguedes, and PrimeDominus!

Dev activity stats for {month}: {} active PRs, {} master commits, {} added and {} deleted lines spread across {} repositories. Contributions came from {}-{} developers per repository. ([chart]({}))

## Network

Hashrate: started and ended the month around 75 PH/s, making the low of 60.5 and a new high of 110 PH/s. BeePool is again the leader with their share varied in 23-54%, followed by F2Pool 13-30%, Coinmine 4-6% and Luxor 3-5%. Like previously, there were multiple spikes of unidentified hashrate.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price is 98 DCR (+2.4). The price varied between 95.7 and 101.92 DCR. Locked DCR amount was 3.86-3.96 million DCR, or 45.7-46.5% of the supply.

Nodes: there are 201 public listening nodes and 325 normal nodes per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats). Version distribution: 5% are v1.4.0(pre) dev builds (+3%), 30% on v1.3.0 (+25%), 42% on v1.2.0 (-20%), 15% on v1.1.2 (-7%), 6% on v1.1.0. More than 76% of nodes run v1.2.0 and higher and therefore support client filters. Data of Oct 1.

## ASICs

Obelisk posted two updates on their [mailing list](https://us16.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=393b2698d17bdfe48ac0422ac&id=87ef82fd96). 70% of Batch 1 units are shipped, an extensive [user guide](http://support.obelisk.tech/category/28qat7hdvu-user-guide) is available, Obelisk Scanner application was released that allows to automatically [update firmware](http://support.obelisk.tech/article/1blv5te02q-upgrade-your-obelisk-firmware). First firmware update was released and bumped SC1 hashrate by 10-20%, added new pools and fixed multiple bugs. Next update will focus on DCR1. It is worth a special mention that the firmware source code is [now open](https://gitlab.com/NebulousLabs/obelisk-ob1)! Let us hope more manufacturers will follow this example.

Whatsminer D10V1 was [announced](https://twitter.com/whatsminer/status/1042946674602201088) and is available for preorder.

A few details about Whatsminer [surfaced](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9fdz9d/psa_do_not_purchase_the_whatsminer_44th_decred/e67ktmc/) this month. The real manufacturer is MicroBT, also known as Bitwei and commonly misspelled as Bitewei. [whatsminer.net](https://whatsminer.net/product/d10v1-44-x-th-s-decred-whatsminer-includes-220v-psu-batch1-ships-december-10/) and [pangolinminer.com](https://pangolinminer.com/product/whatsminer-dcr/) are resellers, and the price is $4,198 on both sites. Pangolinminer and [asicminervalue.com](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/microbt/whatsminer-d1) now call the unit "Whatsminer D1". There was a bit of controversy on Reddit: first whatsminer.net [warned](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9fdz9d/psa_do_not_purchase_the_whatsminer_44th_decred/) our community member against ordering from other sites before an "official announcement", in response Pangolinminer [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9fqfyj/caution_beware_of_announcement_about_dcr_miner/) their arguments against whatsminer.net.

Bitmain has finally [entered](https://twitter.com/antminer_main/status/1043844217288699904) Decred ASIC space with their [Antminer DR3](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=000201809211239039316aJFu5gm069B). Hash rate is 7.8 TH/s while pulling 1410 W, at the price of $673. These specs mean it has the best GH/W and GH/USD of currently sold miners until the Whatsminer or others come out, although its GH/USD of 11.6 already competes with Whatsminer's 10.5. Discussed on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9i96ud/bitmain_releases_decred_miner_dr3_78th_for_673usd/) and [bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5035938.0), unboxing video [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9l0n84/bitmain_antminer_dr3_unboxing_review_and_setting/).

## Integrations

Meet our 17th voting service provider: [decredvoting.com](https://decredvoting.com/). It is operated by [@david](https://decred.slack.com/team/U0RTS3P98), has 2% fee and supports [ticket splitting](https://decredvoting.com/ticketsplitting). Reddit thread is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9c6s3l/new_voting_service_provider_aka_stake_pool_is_now/).

For a historical note, the first VSP to support ticket splitting was [decredbrasil.com](https://stake.decredbrasil.com/):

> @matheusd started tests on testnet several months ago. I contacted him so we could integrate with the pool in June this year. We set up the machine in July and bought the first split ticket on mainnet, using the decredbrasil pool, on July 19. It was voted on July 30. After this first vote on mainnet, we opened the tests to selected users (with more technical background) on the pool. In August we opened the tests to everyone, and would call people who want to join to the #ticket_splitting channel, or to our own Slack (in Portuguese, so mostly Brazilian users). We have 28 split tickets already voted, and 16 are live. So little more than 40 split tickets total were bought on decredbrasil pool. (@girino in [#pos-voting](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!wSdymYrEpBhsWlDJuk:decred.org/$153865859420017BGaFx:decred.org))

[KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/) exchange [listed](https://news.kucoin.com/en/decred-dcr-gets-listed-on-kucoin/) DCR/BTC and DCR/ETH pairs. To celebrate their anniversary they had a 99% trading fees [discount](https://news.kucoin.com/en/99-discount-over-the-trading-fees-on-dcr-trading-pairs/) on DCR pairs for 2 weeks.

Three more wallets integrated Decred in September:

* [Atomic](https://atomicwallet.io/) desktop [added](https://twitter.com/atomicwallet/status/1042032573168476160) Decred in version 0.1.31. The team [answered](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9igvgg/warm_welcome_decred_in_atomic_swap_wallet/e6lki2j/) many questions on Reddit. 
* [AnyBit](https://www.anybit.io/) wallet [added](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1043228642992640000) Decred. It features built-in price and news tracking. Notably, the source code is open for their [Android](https://github.com/AnyBitIO/anybit-Android) and [iOS](https://github.com/AnyBitIO/anybit-iOS) wallets.
* [Cobo](https://cobo.com/) wallet [added](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1045765231157399554) Decred support into their Android and iOS wallets.

ChangeNow [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9f7nga/decred_is_now_available_on_changenows_android_app/) Decred addition to their Android app that allows accountless swaps between 150+ assets.

Coinbase [launched](https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1045813201508524032) informational [asset pages](https://blog.coinbase.com/experimenting-with-educational-asset-pages-b0b4d54b887b) for top 50 coins by market cap, including Decred. First the pages [started showing](https://www.bitguru.co.uk/crypto-news/coinbase-error-shows-44-additional-cryptocurrencies-on-the-app/) in the Coinbase app for a small group of testers, and later the web [price dashboard](https://www.coinbase.com/price) went live. Interestingly, Decred is #25 on that list while it is #30 on [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) as of writing.

## Adoption

The birth of a Brazilian girl was registered on the Decred blockchain using OriginalMy, a blockchain proof of authenticity services provider. Read the full story in [Portuguese](https://www.criptomoedasfacil.com/brasileiro-realiza-primeiro-registro-de-nascimento-na-blockchain-da-decred/) and in [English](https://www.cryptovibes.com/crypto-news/the-world-first-newborn-registered-on-decred-dcr-blockchain-is-a-brazilian/).

* Blockchains are not companies by Dean Eigenmann ([medium](https://medium.com/@decanus/blockchains-are-not-companies-9f8ed7c13018)) discussed in [#governance](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!tIDEIWechmqCLjPiui:decred.org/$15360994197133cjLXA:decred.org)
* How the DEX could benefit Decred:

  > The trouble with infrastructure, "thin" protocols in particular, is that someone has to build them at a cost. e.g. LN takes a ton of work, doesn't necessarily generate value itself, but it magnifies the value of BTC or whatever coin that uses it. I see the DEX in a similar light - whoever creates it is not going to make a bunch of money from it, but it will magnify the value of the underlying asset(s) that end up having a deep order book on the DEX.
