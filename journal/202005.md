May's highlights:

- The new vspd software was introduced, this will replace the existing dcrstakepool software used by VSP operators, and significantly improve the VSP staking experience for all users once v1.6 is released by eliminating the requirement for VSP user accounts.
- The Decred DEX software is in open testing, if you're feeling adventurous why not atomic swap some testnet credits?
- Significant new components of Politeia are falling into place, RFP proposals and on the CMS side all-contractor voting functionality.
- Test builds of the v1.5 updates for both mobile apps are now available through the respective app stores - testers are very welcome to submit issues on GitHub.

## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

- reworked HTTPS [seeding](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2188) (for reference, the network is [migrating](https://matrix.to/#/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$156556717014681nMMAT:decred.org) to seeding over HTTPS because it is more secure, does not require a large dependency surface like DNSSEC, and is more flexible)
- [banning](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2110) peers that don't follow the wire protocol
- more code migrated to the Go 1.13 error handling

In progress:

- TSPEND opcode needed for decentralized control of the Treasury by the stakeholders was successfully [tested](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/1263185839028350976) on testnet

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

- added client [package](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1726) for JSON-RPC calls
- ability to request multiple blocks from the same peer [concurrently](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1730) (one of the needed changes for SPV support in dcrlnd)
- ability to save [per-ticket](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1737) vote preferences (step towards ticket-based VSP)

In progress:

- [hardened](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1743) account support for ticket-based VSP API

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton):

- code refactoring, more components reused from pi-ui
- codebase [prettified](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2481) with automated rules to improve readability
- UI tweaks

In progress:

- [mixed](https://twitter.com/_vctt/status/1265397168317366283) transactions

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia):

- RFP process implemented in the [backend](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1054) and the [GUI](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1910) - a big change in development for a long time, has been implemented and is in testing
- admin utility to [change email](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1178) address
- [short URLs](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/900) for proposals

- progress towards viewing Politeia with [no javascript](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1834)
- two temporary workarounds were implemented to mitigate the annoying duplicate comments bug: one where the expensive file system check is run [once a day](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1205) instead of once an hour, and another where commenting is temporarily [blocked](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1944) during the time when the bug would be triggered
- lots of bug fixes

CMS:

- [all-contractor](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1104) vote for contentious DCCs, weighted by the number of billed hours over the previous 6 months - the final part of implementing the DCC process [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4)
- [utility](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1179) to test DCC issuance and DCC vote processes

In progress:

- admin feature to query [code stats](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1185) for contractors

[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd):

vspd is a from-scratch implementation of VSP software that will bring a huge improvement to the privacy of VSP users, and by extension, the security of the Decred network. It will also be much easier to use for having no registration, no emails, no CAPTCHAs, and no redeem scripts to back up. Check the [announcement](https://blog.decred.org/2020/06/02/A-More-Private-Way-to-Stake/) for more details.

[MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) for vspd is nearing completion and dcrwallet integration is starting. The only outstanding feature for MVP is to get cross-wallet consistency checks to ensure all wallets are voting on the right tickets, and with the right voting choices.

[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool):

v1.1 release candidate is ready for testing! This release includes [reworked](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/207) payments processing, refreshed UI/UX, higher efficiency via dcrd's work notifications, and a host of smaller improvements and bug fixes. Check the full [release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/releases/tag/v1.1.0-rc1) for details.

[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd):

@matheusd posted a [demo](https://twitter.com/matheusd_tech/status/1263118566418776065) of swapping between BTC and DCR invoices across their respective LNs. This is effectively an "instant exchange", except it is using LN and is non-custodial. Note that this prototype has a known gaming vector and more R&D is required to resolve it (ideally based on [PTLCs](https://suredbits.com/payment-points-monotone-access-structures/), but it is quite far away in the future). More details in [this chat](https://matrix.to/#/!LtiDnUlfuRJMekjFSx:decred.org/$ILkQ49LXwBrUcMq5R_JRIkTcjR7FG9lxwMWsxDve2K0).

[dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex):

- more secure [handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/291) of encryption password
- overhaul of client wallet configuration, allowing the user to specify a wallet config file or manually enter settings (parts: [1](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/311), [2](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/335), [3](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/346), [4](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/352))
- server support for graceful [trade suspension](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/287) and client notifications that are used for planned maintenance and market reconfiguration
- [expanded](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/378) "Your Orders" table in client's browser interface
- [display](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/348) of epoch (pending) limit orders on depth chart as a separate dashed line. Epoch orders are orders that have been submitted, but yet to be processed by the order matching algorithm. This provides a preview of how the market is changing during an open epoch, which is on the order of 10 seconds. 
- client [balance update](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/418) improvements to give a more up-to-date balance value
- [Litecoin support](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/372) for the client. LTC was already supported by the server, dcrdex, but now the client can use LTC wallets and place orders for LTC markets.
- [trade command](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/315) to allow placing trades from the command line
- [exchanges command](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/314) to allow listing and configuring exchanges from the command line
- market [search box](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/426) to the Markets page of the client's browser interface
- improved [notification](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/343) of registration events (e.g. fee payment confirmations completed)
- [sign out](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/347) action
- multiple bug fixes and code refactoring

A total of 59 PRs from 10 contributors were [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2020-05-01..2020-05-31+sort%3Aupdated-asc), adding 10K and deleting 3K lines of code.

Upcoming work includes: Server support for suspend/restore active swaps (swap state), better support for client-initiated refund or swap completion (refund) in the event of failure of the server-driven swap negotiation due to a down server or counter party inaction, expanded client RPCs, expanded server admin commands, improved client handling of server suspend/resume messages.

Testnet testing [has begun](https://twitter.com/chappjc/status/1267115398610255874) and everybody is welcome to [participate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/wiki/Testnet-Testing). There's still a good chance that mainnet DEX will launch this summer.

## Governance

In May the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 13,594 DCR and spent 19,153 DCR. Using May's daily average DCR/USD rate of $14.11, this is $192K received and $270K spent. At April's average daily rate of $12.34, the USD figure billed for work completed in that month is $236K. As of Jun 5, Treasury balance is 630,983 DCR (11.4 million USD at $18.12).

There were 5 proposals submitted in May, and 4 of these started voting in early Jun. There was no Politeia proposal voting in May.

The new proposals are described in [issue 31](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue031/) of Politeia Digest and the vote outcomes will be covered in the next issue.

## Network

Hashrate: [May's hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=k9nb7wvw-kavn2b1a&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~357 Ph/s and closed ~386 Ph/s, bottoming at 260 Ph/s and peaking at 541 Ph/s throughout the month. Pool [hashrate distribution](https://dcrstats.com/pow) as of Jun 1 (approximate): UUPool 38%, Poolin 18%, lab.antpool.com 12%, F2Pool 1.5%, Luxor 1.3%, BTC.com 1.3%, BeePool 0.1%, CoinMine 0.03%, Suprnova 0.02% and others ~28%.

Staking: [30-day average](https://dcrstats.com/) ticket price was 141.5 DCR (+3.7). The [price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=k9nb7wvw-kavn2b1a&bin=window&axis=time&visibility=true-false&mode=stepped) varied between 132.9-159.2 DCR. [Locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=k9nb7wvw-kavn2b1a&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was 5.59-5.80 million DCR, which corresponded to 48.7-50.3% of the available supply [participating](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=k9nb7wvw-kavn2b1a&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in PoS.

Nodes: Throughout [May](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=1588291200000&to=1590969600000) there was an average of 144 public listening nodes and 229 total nodes per dcr.farm. Average version distribution for May: 48% dcrd v1.5.1, 11% dcrd v1.5.0, 6% dcrd v1.6 dev builds, 4% dcrd v1.5 dev and RC builds, 2% dcrd v1.4, 9% dcrwallet v1.5.1, 1.4% dcrwallet v1.5, 1.4% dcrwallet v1.4, and 13% others.

Lewis Harland published a piece of [research](https://formalverification.substack.com/p/in-the-network-decred) about the Decred network that considers a number of metrics, including the ratio of hashrate to USD block reward which represents miners' risk. It notes a decline of several metrics since Jan 2020 and suggests that DCR is trading at a loss relative to the total USD input to the network.

@PermabullNino released another on-chain [research piece](https://medium.com/@permabullnino/decred-on-chain-mining-pulse-3b28d5155a04) where he explores Decred block times and introduces the Mining Pulse indicator.

## Integrations

[Transak](https://global.transak.com/) brought a new way to purchase DCR with a debit card for residents of the US, EU, and many other countries, thanks to a [partnership](https://twitter.com/transak_finance/status/1265690509844131846) with Wyre. "Transak uses smart contracts to connect the end-user to liquidity on centralized and decentralized exchanges. Users will have to input simple KYC information, but the process from start to finish will take less than 5 minutes". Now Transak is live in 32 countries, supporting 14 fiat currencies and 300+ cryptoassets.

## Markets

In May DCR was trading between USD 12.62-15.66 / BTC 0.0014-0.00167. The average daily rate was $14.11.

A [seasonality study](https://medium.com/coinmonks/decred-price-a-seasonality-study-414bac98bc99) by OneAnalyst explored day-of-the-week and month-of-the-year effect on DCR's daily returns (DCR seems to favor Saturdays).

A [wrap-up](https://blockcommons.red/publication/mm-phase1-wrapup/) of phase 1 market maker activity by @richardred analyzed order book depth over time for DCR and other assets, concluding that it didn't see an organic increase beyond the orders maintained by i2.

Bitcoin's long-anticipated third halving of new issuance occurred on May 11, dominating the crypto news agenda for some period around this date and even penetrating [more](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/11/bitcoin-halving-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html) [mainstream](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52628034) [sources](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/bitcoin-halving-price-prediction-2020-a9488506.html) - much of it focusing on what effect it might have on the price.

Reddit introduced new blockchain-based tokens to be trialled on /r/cryptocurrency ([Moons](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/gj96lb/introducing_rcryptocurrency_moons/)) and /r/FortNiteBR ([Bricks](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/gj8tm1/introducing_rfortnitebr_bricks/)). Tokens will be awarded to users of a subreddit in relation to their karma scores (50%), 10% for moderators, 20% for Reddit, and 20% for the "broader Reddit community". In addition to serving as a badge of reputation on the subreddit points can be used to unlock features like posting gifs in comments. Points-weighted variants of polls have also been described.

Tech giants and dozens of governments have decided that smartphones are not backdoored _enough_ and initiated an unprecedented mass [surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_surveillance#Digital_surveillance) program (attributed to COVID-19). Many [technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_apps) have "privacy-preserving" added somewhere in the title and it might be [really secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches) this time. There is even a promise to [terminate](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-and-google-say-they-will-shut-down-covid-19-tracking-tools-once-pandemic-ends/) the tracking systems once the pandemic "ends". Sarcasm aside, for cryptocurrency users it means a bunch of new privacy and security risks on their mobile devices and a strong incentive to consider [alternative](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) operating systems or even hardware.
