## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover its most notable dev work._
- _For each project, the order of reporting is "most released first": changes released to end users, merged to master, in progress (work started), discussions and future plans._
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

}


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commits/master }

- {}


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commits/master }

- {}


### dcrctl

_[dcrctl](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl) is a command-line client for dcrd and dcrwallet._

{ _Hint: dcrctl is pulling most of the code from dcrd and dcrwallet. Often there is not much to report and this section can be removed._ }

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/commits/master }

- {}


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/decrediton/commits/master }

The Wallet Launcher has been [redesigned](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3690).

- Added onboarding tutorials to the launcher.
- Added gradients to the wallet cards. One gradient is connected to an exact wallet and saved to the config. 
- Moved the redesigned progress bar to the bottom. 
- Removed the 'RescanWallet' component. The rescan progress is integrated now into the progress bar and the onboarding tutorials list is displayed during the progress.
- Introduced a new progress bar indication of the fetching block headers process.
- Added a Trezor wallet setup option.
- Added an Automated Wallet Launching modal. User choice is saved to config.

DEX:

- Fixed problem where DEX window [wouldn't launch](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3831) after reloading UI.
- When changing [wallet passphrase](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3822), users can enter their DEX app password to propagate the changes to their DEX account. {confusing, need to update}
- [Removed](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3800) all BTC wallet type selection and added tests for the DEX.
- [Bumped](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3834) DCRDEX to v0.5.6.

Other changes: {need to update Controlactions section}

- Fixed issue where [focus](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3839) between seed words was lost on the Trezor word modal.
- Applied [proxy settings](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3803) to dcrd and dcrwallet when the proxy type is SOCKS 5. With this, users can configure dcrd/dcrwallet as a Tor client. (img candidate)
- Added [translations](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3719) for Greek.
- Fixed an issue in the Lightning Network tab where the "Close Channel" button was [hidden](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3796) in inactive channels.
- Voting preferences now [update asynchronously](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3801). Developer bgptr reports that the process takes 3 times faster on mainnet (3 seconds vs 11 seconds). The error handling was also improved. (img candidate).
- Fixes to transactions action (update).
- Finished [testing](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3821) of 'ControlActions'. Also discarded the unused importPrivateKey code and introduced accountMocks which contains shared mocks with AccountMixerActions tests. (more)
- Removed all [legacy stakepool related code](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3808). Also cleaned up the code structure relating to ticket purchases and auto buyer. The privacy tab now properly shows that mixes are created every 10 minutes, not 20.
- Redesigned the [Trezor wallet viewpage](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3570). (img candidate)
- Automated tests for 'DaemonActions'.
- Added [links to documentation](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3802) in the form of question mark blurbs throughout the wallet.
- Recently updated VSPs now have vote choices [resent](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3738).
- Added [internal ticket spent](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3778) and transaction fee links on the transactions details page.
- Various [CSS fixes](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3805).
- Fixed blockchain download [time estimation](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3815) during syncing.
- [Fixes](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3804) to 'filterUnlockableAccounts'.
- Revamped [transaction normalizers](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3777).
- Renamed win32ipc to dcrwin32ipc to [avoid problems](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3828) with a a remote suspiscious package of the same name.
- [Upgrades](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3826) to 'pi-ui'.
