## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover its most notable dev work._
- _For each project, the order of reporting is "most released first": changes released to end users, merged to master, in progress (work started), discussions and future plans._
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

}


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commits/master }

- Update peer [attempt timestamp](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3014) before trying to connect to it.
- Simplified how raw transactions and their additional [descriptions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3015) are stored in the mempool.
- Tweaked [memory management](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3016) to spend less CPU time doing garbage collection. With this dcrd can perform the initial chain sync about 10% faster at the cost of using more memory. A nice side benefit is that advanced sysadmins can now tune this behavior using an environment variable.
- [Enabled](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3017) and set [as default](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3019) new peer-to-peer protocol version that no longer uses the `reject` message. The message was inherited from the original btcsuite codebase and was used to signal that a transaction or a block is ["rejected"](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#reject) by a peer. Using this message for pretty much anything was unreliable or incorrect and a [proposal](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2546) was made to remove it. Peers negotiating to this new protocol version will no longer send `reject` messages and consider it a violation if they receive it. Any peers negotiating to an older version will not be punished for sending `reject` and it will be ignored by newer nodes.
- Added new [IPC events](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3020) to notify the parent process of the address and port assigned to dcrd. In configurations where dcrd is controlled by another process like Decrediton or an automated test runner, that parent process needs to know which addresses and ports dcrd uses for its P2P interface (talking to the public network) and RPC interface (local communications with wallets and other clients). This change provides a reliable way to discover dcrd's ports when they are randomly assigned by the operating system and not configured by the parent process.
- Always respond to [`getheaders`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3030) requests from peers. Previous logic would not respond to `getheaders` if the local chain was not considered to be fully synced with the network. In the old "blocks first" syncing model it helped to avoid some undesirable corner cases, like unnecessarily downloading blocks. It had downsides too, like a node could appear to be unresponsive or stalled to its peers, while being active and simply not having any interesting data to share. In the current "headers first" syncing model this limitation is no longer necessary, and serving up headers before the peer is known to be current no longer leads to undesirable behavior.
- Other internal/infra changes { 3021 3023 3022 }

RPC server:

- Optimized WebSocket client disconnection handling and fixed spurious messages when WebSocket clients disconnect.
- Modified the [lifecycle](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3025) of WebSocket clients to use contexts, which is more flexible for the calling code.
- Added [cancellation support](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3027) for the `getwork` request (used by miners) and optimized handling of multiple concurrent `getwork` requests. { _could not understand deeper what blocked what before, maybe it's enough but can add more_ }
- RPC testing framework has been extracted into the new `dcrtest/dcrdtest` package in its own repository. It is used to write integration-level tests which exercise features and behaviors of the fully compiled dcrd binary (as opposed to unit tests, which test small parts of the code). { _why was it extracted?_ }

{ _explain the new dcrtest repo_ }


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commits/master }

- Updated the [major version](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2189) of the `decred.org/dcrwallet` module to version 3, updated all dependencies of current in-progress modules from dcrd to their corresponding major versions, removed unused code.
- Allow [piping the answers](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2191) to the `--create` prompts to work properly for not only the initial passphrase prompt, but the confirmation as well. This helps to automate wallet creation (e.g. by piping all answers from a text file).
- Hex seed [wallet restoration](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2192) no longer requires an additional newline. This also helps [non-interactive](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/issues/2190) (automated) deployments of dcrwallet.
- Added RPC requests to allow Decrediton to get and update the [pending TSpend policies](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2172).


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

[v1.7.6 release](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.7.6):

- [Upgraded](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3834) DCRDEX module to v0.5.6 (bug fixes for BTC and DCR) and added an icon to the DEX window.

Decredition's Wallet Launcher has been [redesigned](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3690):

- Added onboarding tutorials to the launcher.
- Added gradients to the wallet cards. Each wallet's gradient is saved in the config.
- Moved the redesigned progress bar to the bottom. 
- Removed the `RescanWallet` component. The rescan progress is now integrated into the progress bar and the onboarding tutorials list is displayed during the progress.
- Introduced a new progress bar indication of the fetching block headers process.
- Added a Trezor wallet setup option.
- Added an Automated Wallet Launching modal. User choice is saved to config.

DEX:

- [Removed](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3800) Bitcoin wallet setup steps in favor of the built-in BTC wallet provided by the DEX module. Added tests for DEX views and actions.
- When changing [wallet passphrase](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3822), users can enter their DEX app password to make the DEX aware of the new wallet passphrase. This fixes confusing passphrase change UX for those using the DEX via Decrediton.
- Fixed problem where DEX window [wouldn't launch](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3831) after reloading UI.

Other changes:

- Renamed package `win32ipc` to `dcrwin32ipc` to [avoid confusion](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3828) with a suspiscious remote package of the same name. It was determined that there was never any risk to Decred software from this other suspicious package and Decrediton's module was always loaded from locally built assets.
- Revamped [transaction processing](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3777) code to improve performance and enable automated testing.
- [Added links](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3778) to ticket spent and VSP fee on the transactions details page. These links now open locally in Decrediton instead of sending to dcrdata. If the linked transaction is not yet in memory (e.g. it is too old), it will be fetched from dcrwallet in the background.
- Added a launch step to resend vote preferences to [recently upgradeded VSPs](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3738). Consensus vote choices sent to a VSP running older software are lost because the VSP is not aware of the new consensus votes. If such VSP upgrades, it may be [necessary](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/3723) to resend vote choices to it, so it could vote on latest consensus agendas with the tickets it manages.
- Added [links to documentation](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3802) in the form of question mark blurbs throughout the wallet.
- Redesigned the [Trezor pages](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3570).
- Removed all [legacy stakepool related code](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3808). Also cleaned up the code structure relating to ticket purchases and auto buyer. The privacy tab now properly shows that mixes are created every 10 minutes, not 20.
- Improved the flow of [purchasing one mixed ticket](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3819) by automating the steps: disable the mixer, buy the ticket, re-enable the mixer.
- Voting preferences now [update asynchronously](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3801). Developer @bgptr reports that the process takes 3 times faster on mainnet (3 seconds vs 11 seconds). The error handling was also improved.
- Added [basic and advanced](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/blob/fabcf6b81d50ac11c9502af0117d654c21e8c3bc/app/i18n/community_translators.md) translations for [Greek](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3719).
- Apply [proxy settings](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3803) to dcrd and dcrwallet when the proxy type is SOCKS5. With this, users can configure dcrd and dcrwallet to communicate over the Tor network.
- Increased coverage of automated UI tests. { 3814 3811 3821 }
- Dependency upgrades { 3826 3833 3827 }, including a switch to [Node 16](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3837) and [Electron 18](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3832).

{ maybe further break down into smaller lists }

Fixes:

- Fixed undesired [locking](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3804) of the wallet account used by the auto ticket buyer.
- Fixed blockchain download [time estimation](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3815) during syncing.
- Fixed 4 minor [color and layout](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3805) issues.
- Fixed the missing [relocking](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3819) after a successful or failed ticket purchase, autobuyer or running mixer, etc. Account locking status is now shown on Accounts page for easier tracking.
- Fixes to [Transaction views](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3789): truncate long addresses and account names, show ticket's spending transaction, fixed block hash display, fixed some tickets incorrectly reported as Solo.
- Fixed inability to [close inactive channels](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3796) in the Lightning Network tab.
- Fixed issue where [focus](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3839) was lost between seed words when restoring a Trezor wallet.

Dev tools and docs:

- Documented how to install and upgrade [Electron devtools](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3825).
- Added scripts to analyze [bundle size](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3826).

### Politeia

_[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia) is Decred's proposal system. It is used to request funding from the Decred treasury._

{ _Check these repos:_

- https://github.com/decred/politeia/commits/master
- https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/commits/master
- https://github.com/decred/pi-ui/commits/master

}

All changes below are towards the GUI remake on the new [plugin architecture](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/tree/master/plugins-structure#politeiagui---plugins-structure).

[Improved navigation](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2866):

- Added a navigation service to the `core` package. `core` is a basic building block and its services can be used from any plugin or a Politeia-like app.
- Dynamically update page title according to proposal's name.
- Added a reusable "Go Back" link component and fixed legacy errors.

Other:

- Build and test against [Node 18 and 19](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui).
- Added [tests](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2876) for common UI components.
- Added a [toolkit](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2869) to simplify configuration and composition of plugins and their services.
- Added [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2873) to build and test the new GUI remake separately from the existing GUI app.
- Implemented initial [Submitted Proposals](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2877) view in the user Account page.
- Fixed handling of some [errors](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2872) returned from server, and fixed/updated related end-to-end tests.


### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software for running a Voting Service Provider. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/vspd/commits/master }

- Added a [`vote-validator` tool](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/335). This allows VSP admins to verify that their vspd deployment is voting correctly according to user preferences.
- Include [Git commit](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/357) in app version string.
- Added a [reusable HTTP client module](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/359) for vspd API consumers. This will be useful for dcrwallet, dcrwebapi, and testing tools such as v3tool. { _logically includes 356 360 - just noting for now_ }
- [Build system](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/362) improvements.


### Lightning Network

_[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant and low-cost transactions._

{ _Check these repos:_

- https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/commits/master
- https://github.com/decred/dcrlnlpd/commits/master

}

- Updated the [latest](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/168) dcrd and dcrwallet test versions. This required fixing the simnet miner to account for the ticket exhaustion error that could happen during mining.
- Added the [option](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/170) to switch the gap policy when generating new addresses to Wrap instead of the default one in dcrwallet. This fixes an [issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/issues/169) where trying to generate an address for lnwallet to open or close a channel would result in an error.


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

{ _Check these repos:_

- https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commits/master
- https://github.com/decred/dexweb/commits/master

}

[v0.5.5 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.5.5):

- Fixed a bad revision of goleveldb that was pulled in by go-ethereum by manually [downgrading](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1938) it.
- Fixed another issue with [big Taproot transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1936) on Bitcoin mainnet by upgrading btcd again.

[v0.5.6 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.5.6):

- Fixed [unmixed account](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1954) not being unlocked in some mixed account configurations, in order to prevent failure of swap refunds.
- Fixed built-in DCR wallets reported as [ready](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1955) too soon.

[v0.5.7 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.5.7):

- Cancel orders that the client [doesn't know about](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1889). This fixes a variety of edge cases encountered in the wild where the client could lose some of its orders (e.g. by using a corrupt database file, failing to save orders, etc.).
- Fixed bug where [orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1971) would be retired/non-existent on the client but still booked on the server. It could happen if the client initiates trade order cancellation, fails to respond to a [preimage request](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/blob/75bb91da9b2f65b52835cb8235bcc1a7fd7b893b/spec/orders.mediawiki#order-commitment) from the server (e.g. by briefly disconnecting), and incorrectly marks the trade order as [revoked](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1971), while in reality the cancellation has failed and the trade order is still booked on the server.

A [market-maker bot](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1738) has been added. The bot uses some internal and (optionally) external signals to calculate an ideal buy and sell price and a "break-even spread", which is the spread at which a buy-sell sequence's tx fees equal its profit. These values can be used as inputs into one of 5 "gap strategies", which determine the target spread. The code is structured to support more trading routines in the future. UI was added to create, configure and monitor existing market maker bots.

Client:

- Added support for "self-governed" trades when the [server is down](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1866). Clients need a way to complete started trades even if the server goes down or mysteriously loses the market information.
- Database [path](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1951) is now logged on startup.
- Made order placement [more responsive](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1887). The order form will close sooner and order submission will continue in the background.
- Show or hide [advanced order options](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1885) by default.
- Fixes to [mmbot](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1866). { _minor, drop_ }
- Fixed bug where [fiat rates](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1974) weren't being displayed. Frequency of fetching fiat rates has been reduced to avoid hitting the rate limits.

Fidelity bonds (client and server):

- Implemented more [foundational building blocks](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1819): added messages to manage bonds, changed server's account management to a tiered system, updated server's database to track client bonds. There will be no invalidation of bonds due to bad behavior, and instead a user's tier is a balance between bond "strength" and their conduct score. Misbehaving users may need to lock more funds in additional bonds to restore their tier and trade again.

Server:

- Fixed calculation of [DOGE fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1965).
- Fail fast if [transaction index](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1973) is not enabled for Bitcoin-like assets. It is essential for DEX operation, without the index the DEX will fail to look up transactions.

DCR

- Fixed `Swapconfirmations` not doing a [block filters scan](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1866). { _drop, too technical and is part of 1866 already reported above_ }

BTC 

- SPV test made [more robust](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1939). { _drop, we normally don't report individual changes in test infra, unless they are very big/notable_ }
- Users can now [see and manage the peers](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1931) that the BTC SPV wallets are connected to, as well as add new peers.

UI

- More nuanced [match statuses](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1866) and swap steps. { _report in the other bullet for 1866_ }

Other

- Fixed wallet [enable delay](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1866). { _report in the other bullet for 1866_ }
- Keep revoked matches as "active" until the [redeeming tx is confirmed](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1948), which is a bit more robust. { _minor, group?_ }
- Fixed [error](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1953) on markets page for unsupported wallets. Fixed panic when trying to create specific wallets. { _minor, group with other fixes_ }
- Various other tweaks/fixes.

{ image candidates: 1738 1887 }


### dcrdata

_[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata) is an explorer for Decred blockchain and off-chain data like Politeia proposals, markets, and more._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/commits/master }

- Fixed various frontend bugs, importantly ones relating to [treasury spends and adds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1933).



### Rosetta

_[dcrros](https://github.com/decred/dcrros) is a middleware service that provides access to the Decred network via Rosetta API._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrros/commits/master }

- Switched the stable version of the 'dcrror' Dockerfile to use the recently tagged [v0.2.0 version](https://github.com/decred/dcrros/pull/30).
- [Updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrros/pull/27) master to release v1.7.5.


### decred.org

_[dcrweb](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb) is the source code for the [decred.org](https://decred.org/) website._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/commits/master }

- Updated [YouTube link](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1096) with new channel alias [@DecredTV](https://www.youtube.com/@DecredTV).

## Governance

{ _Hint: Currently this is a mix of finances and governance. We may add the separate Finances section in the future._ }

In November the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 8,473 DCR worth $186K at November's average rate of $21.92. 2,646 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $58K at November's rate, or $70K at October's billing rate of $26.27.

The [treasury spend tx](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/tx/95ebb23a0846417eb1aa6a59bf6b4ad49d8cd72ff44c869d4af366fd1aef402e) had 25 outputs making payments to contractors, ranging from 3 DCR to 1108 DCR. It was approved on Dec 5 with unanimous yes votes.

{ _Other interesting facts/stories about the legacy or new treasury._ }

As of Dec 10, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 830,186 DCR (17.8 million USD at $21.48).

The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/0848cc9) to fund [@dcrtimestampbot](https://twitter.com/dcrtimestampbot) twitter bot with $1,950 was approved with 91.4% yes votes and turnout of 33%.

## Network

{ _Hint: "Network" tracks key "health" metrics of the fundamental infrastructure._ }

{ _Hint: n, n.n, and n.nn tell how many decimals to keep, e.g. 100, 16.5, 8.63_ }

**Hashrate**: November's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of {} Ph/s hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

{ _Hint: Fallback links for pool distribution: https://poolbay.io/crypto/54/decred , https://dcrstats.com/pow ._ }

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between {n}-{n} DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}).

{ _Hint: Besides dramatic "epic fails", try to also report some "epic wins" in areas relevant to Decred. We can learn from both._ }

The US Attorney's Office has [confiscated](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-attorney-announces-historic-336-billion-cryptocurrency-seizure-and-conviction) over 50,000 BTC (valued at $3.36 Billion) which was apparently obtained through "a sophisticated scheme designed to steal bitcoin from the notorious Silk Road Marketplace". The sophisticated scheme involved depositing BTC and then immediately (*i.e.* within the same second) requesting withdrawals of this amount multiple times, which would duly be processed by the Silk Road's server at the time. The BTC was confiscated from one James Zhong, along with some cash, equities and precious metals. Some of the BTC was stored "on a single-board computer that was submerged under blankets in a popcorn tin stored in a bathroom closet". Zhong had exchanged the BCH which accrued to their addresses for more BTC on an offshore cryptocurrency exchange, and this may have played a role in allowing the authorities to track him down.

The cryptocurrency exchange FTX has [filed](https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/ftx-bankruptcy-sam-bankman-fried) for bankruptcy protection and halted all withdrawals for its International and US sites, affecting [over](https://www.reuters.com/technology/ftx-officials-contact-with-us-regulators-filing-2022-11-15/) 1 million users. The collapse of FTX started with a [story](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/) on Coindesk about a leaked balance sheet for Alameda Research (one of Sam Bankman-Fried's companies) indicating that it was heavily reliant on FTT tokens (for the FTX exchange) which it was placing a higher than market value on.  CZ of Binance fuelled the fire by suggesting that Binance would liquidate its substantial FTT holdings in light of this information. Alameda tried to prop up the FTT price for some time but it dropped significantly and this made them insolvent, in the process triggering a run of withdrawal requests from increasingly panicked FTX users which ultimately FTX was unable to meet. SBF confirmed that something was very wrong by [tweeting](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1590012124864348160) that Binance were going to step in and buy FTX to ensure all customers would be able to access their funds, an arrangement which [fell apart](https://twitter.com/binance/status/1590449161069268992) within a day, and within a few days there were [reports](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/crypto-markets-teeter-with-ftx-after-binance-abandons-bailout-2022-11-10/) that SBF was looking for a $9.4 Billion rescue package from investors. After declaring bankruptcy a big chunk of FTX's crypto balances started moving, it has apparently been "hacked" by a (former) insider. The appointed administrator has [criticised](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/17/ftx-enron-crypto-collapse-john-ray-unprecedented) FTX as one of the worst run companies he has ever seen (he administered Enron's bankruptcy among others). SBF has been tweeting and giving interviews intermittently throughout the saga, [against](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/12/02/sam-bankman-frieds-self-incrimination-tour/) the advice of his lawyers (who have dropped him as a client), and many crypto commentators have been [lamenting](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/11/30/ftxs-collapse-was-a-crime-not-an-accident/) the relatively kind treatment he has received in the mainstream press.

There have been a number of high profile crypto companies who have struggled with the [contagion](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/23/ftx-contagion-revives-dreaded-2022-crypto-knell-the-withdrawal-halt/) of FTX/Alameda's collapse and the unravelling "Sam coins". The Gemini exchange had to [pause](https://www.bankingdive.com/news/blockfi-bankruptcy-gemini-genesis-halt-withdrawal-redemption-ftx-lawsuit/636715/) withdrawals and BlockFi first suspended withdrawals then filed for [bankruptcy](https://blockfi.com/November28-ClientUpdate). The Digital Currency Group's brokerage Genesis [suspended](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/11/16/crypto-lender-genesis-suspends-withdrawals-ftx-collapse-created-unprecedented-market-turmoil/) withdrawals, while the Grayscale Trust, another DCG company, saw GBTC trading at a 45% discount to BTC, as they [failed](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/21/grayscale-wont-share-proof-of-reserves-due-to-security-concerns.html) to provide definitive "Proof of Reserves".

Proof of Reserves (PoR) is a way of keeping exchanges honest by publishing addresses where they hold customer funds, ideally alongside a list of liabilities, in the aftermath of the FTX collapse PoR has seen renewed attention and [several](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/17/proof-of-reserves-emerges-as-a-favored-way-to-prevent-another-ftx/) exchanges have implemented versions of it to assure customers that their assets are safely held. Nic Carter has a [website](https://niccarter.info/proof-of-reserves/) which outlines the concept and tracks which exchanges have implemented some kind of PoR. There have been [questions](https://beincrypto.com/crypto-exchanges-gate-io-and-crypto-com-appear-to-be-faking-proof-of-reserves/) raised about some of the PoR efforts of exchanges, in particular Crypto.com "mistakenly" sending over $400M worth of Ethereum to Gate.io was seen as a possible attempt to cheat by one or both exchanges.

The LBRY content network, best known for Odysee video app, [lost](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/07/lbry-sold-tokens-as-securities-federal-judge-rules/) its long-running case against the SEC for selling LBRY tokens as an unregistered security. The judge issued a summary judgment that the LBRY tokens were obviously securities, with comments which cast a wide net and would see the majority of crypto tokens classified as securities.
