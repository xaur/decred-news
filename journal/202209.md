Merged in `master` and backported to v0.5.3 release:

- Added external [fallback API for fee info](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1695) for BTC RPC wallets ([mempool.space](https://mempool.space/).
- Fixed swap/redemption [fee info](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1827) and added columns for base and quote fee assets to the CSV export.

Merged in `master`:

- Display [estimated fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1688) when withdrawing assets.
- Improved notifications for [placed orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1803).
- Replace usages of the `settxfee` method with a more robust [`fee_rate` argument](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1706) for `sendtoaddress`. It is only supported with recent versions of Bitcoin Core and its clones. `settxfee` is still supported for older wallets like DOGE's.
- Fixed incorrect market [volume](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1837) on the Wallets page. { minor? }
- Other fixes { 1813 }
- Code maintenance { 1836 }

Ethereum support:

- [Babysit](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1638) refund and redeem transactions. Unlike the UTXO coins, Ethereum's ability to replace one transaction with another with the same nonce requires a more involved tracking.

**Hashrate**: September's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {_set zoom to show the month_} opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of {} Ph/s hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {_monthly zoom_} was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, meaning that {n.n}-{n.n}% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {_monthly zoom_} in Proof of Stake.

{ _Add a recap of ticket price action if it was interesting._ }

**VSP**: On {date}, ~{n} (+{n}) live tickets were managed by [listed](https://decred.org/vsp/) vspd servers. Collectively the {n} VSPs managed {n.n}% of the ticket pool (+{n.n}%).
