## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

September was mostly about optimization and cleanup:

- Optimized block template generation to not fetch [inputs for coinbase](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2994) transaction (one that mints new coins) because it cannot have inputs.
- [Optimized memory](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2993) used by transaction script copying. { _minor, maybe group in Optimizations_ }
- Restored [spend journal cleanup logic](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2997) when blocks are disconnected (it was removed as part of a larger cleanup). { _minor, maybe group in Fixes_ }
- Deprecated the [`--blockminsize`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3002) CLI option. It allowed to add low-fee or free transactions into a block while the block was below the specified minimum size. The policy allowing to relay such low-fee/free transactions was [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2964) (and replaced with the Child Pays For Parent technique) and so this CLI option is no longer needed.
- Reworked [UTXO cache](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2995) to improve its robustness, optimize it, and correct some hard to hit corner cases. This cache provides fast access to coins in circulation (aka Unspent Transaction Outputs - UTXO) and is essential for performance, because on a high level each block spends existing coins and creates new coins. Since it is consensus critical code, the rework was split into 19 independent changes to make it easier to review.
- Added a database migration to [remove UTXOs that cannot be spent](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2996). Specifically, coins created by the `treasurybase` transaction (the 10% part of the block reward that goes to treasury) are never directly spendable and thus should not take space in the UTXO database.
- Removed mempool and mining code dealing with [low-fee and free tx relay policy](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3003). Related `--blockprioritysize` option and fields in the `getrawmempool` response have been deprecated.
- Maintenance: refactoring { 3000 }, upgrades { 2992 } and cleanup { 2998 3001 3004 }


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

- Respect [proxy config](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2184) for SPV and P2P seeder connections.


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

- Upgraded [dcrdex module](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3791) to v0.5.2.
- Updated [German translation](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3798).
- Reused [media breakpoints](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3799) from the [pi-ui](https://github.com/decred/pi-ui/pull/459) library. This removes duplicate screen size definitions from 154 files and makes them consistent with Politeia GUI.


### Politeia

_[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia) is Decred's proposal system. It is used to request funding from the Decred treasury._

Backend:

- Added [v1.4.0 release notes](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1678) to documentation. { _minor_ }
- Fixed ordering of [proposal author updates](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1679).

GUI remake on the new [plugin architecture](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/tree/master/plugins-structure#politeiagui---plugins-structure):

- 4+ [mobile view](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2857) improvements for comments, markdown buttons, proposal page etc.
- Added [unit tests](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2840) for app initialization.
- Fixed [store errors](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2856) discovered with the new tests.

pi-ui library (shared by Politeia and Decrediton):

- Improved sizes in [mobile view](https://github.com/decred/pi-ui/pull/462).
- Fixed [double rendering](https://github.com/decred/pi-ui/pull/463) of modals.


### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software for running a Voting Service Provider. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

- Moved vspd code to [`cmd` direcctory](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/352). It is the final step of [removing global variables](https://github.com/decred/vspd/issues/339) and it allows to build multiple executables from a single repository.
- Made [database backups](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/353) optional. Backups are only required by vspd but not by test code or future upcoming tools (such as [vote validator](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/335)).


### Lightning Network

_[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant and low-cost transactions._

[Liquidity Provider Daemon](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnlpd):

- Changed [the policy for closing channels](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnlpd/pull/7) from an absolute policy (close all channels that don't meet the policy conditions) to a relative policy (based on activity scoring for each channel). The policy enforcement only kicks off after the on-chain wallet balance drops below a new config parameter. The intended result is that channels will not be closed unless the liquidity provider requires coins to fund new channels, preferring to close channels with a combination of low activity during its lifetime. This is a more useful policy in the current state of Decred's LN due to low rates of use.


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

DCRDEX v0.5.3 has been released, featuring an experimental Windows app which starts the DEX client with no terminal, and with a system tray icon. For Windows users, this should feel more natural. Check the [full release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.5.3) for all new features and fixes. This release again provides standalone binaries that can be used independently from Decrediton. As always, we recommend to [verify the files](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/verifying-binaries) before running.

Merged in v0.5.3 release:

- Added a [fallback API for getting fee info](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1695) from external sources. For Bitcoin RPC wallets (i.e. a local Bitcoin Core wallet) it will use [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/) API.
- Fixed swap/redemption [fee info](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1827) and added columns for base and quote fee assets to the CSV export.
- Fixed 4 [edge cases](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1849) with disconnection during trades and invalid responses from the server.
- Fixed candles [delta overflow](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1872) bug.
- Removed [default port](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/e9ca06d353c7aa1f66a120ac8b9b8a6cc021983e) for Electrum.
- Backported several [other fixes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1850) from `master`.

User-facing changes merged in `master`:

- Display [estimated fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1688) when withdrawing funds.
- Improved notifications for [placed orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1803).
- Added a button to [disable a wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1804).
- Added native [SPV wallet for Bitcoin Cash](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1635). "Native" means the wallet is fully managed by the DEX without the need to download/install/configure external software (the BCH wallet), while "SPV" means it works without downloading the BCH blockchain. This currently relies on a [temporary fork](https://github.com/buck54321/neutrino-bch) of [gcash/neutrino](https://github.com/gcash/neutrino) with extra changes needed by DCRDEX, until those changes are merged by the gcash project.
- Added native [SPV wallet for Litecoin](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1750), similar to one for BCH.
- Show [recently matched orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1663).
- Show [system tray icon](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1828) on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Fixed incorrect market [volume](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1837) on Wallets page. { minor? }
- Fixed confusing [ordering of trade steps](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1830) on the Order page and added display of future steps to expect.
- Other fixes { 1813 1843 1841 1855 1856 }

Internal changes merged in `master`:

- Replaced uses of `settxfee` method with a more robust [`fee_rate` argument](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1706) to `sendtoaddress`. It is only supported with recent versions of Bitcoin Core and its clones. Wallets based on older Bitcoin Core will continue to use `settxfee` (BCH, DOGE, ZEC).
- Added a tool for finding missing notification [translations](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1835). Also, notifications will fall back to English strings if a translation is missing.
- Clients will no longer accept signatures of [truncated messages](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1526) - a bug where in some places truncated message data was signed and verified without getting hashed first. The PR explains why this bug was hard to exploit but also quite tricky to fix. This change is the last step of the 4-stage plan to roll out the fix with minimum disruption to older clients.
- Other fixes { 1838 1846 1852 1860 1873 1876 }
- Code maintenance { 1836 1831 1859 1851 }
- Testing { 1742 }
- Documentation { 1842 1839 1824 }

Ethereum support:

- [Babysit](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1638) refund and redeem transactions. Unlike UTXO coins, Ethereum's ability to replace one transaction with another with the same nonce requires more involved tracking.
- Update [fees paid](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1752) after the transaction is mined. For Ethereum-based assets, the exact fee paid cannot be known in advance.

[dex.decred.org](https://dex.decred.org/) landing page:

- Rewritten [How to get started](https://github.com/decred/dexweb/pull/26) text.
- Added [nice icons](https://github.com/decred/dexweb/pull/27) for all 6 supported assets.

DCRDEX aims to support trading with lightweight wallets, which is a massive boost to user experience compared to having to download full blockchains. For Decred it uses its native SPV protocol and for Bitcoin it relies on the [Neutrino](https://github.com/lightninglabs/neutrino) wallet from Lightning Labs (which itself uses btcsuite). Neutrino forks for Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash are [not as well maintained](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1750#issuecomment-1201859406) however, so the team has created [neutrino-bch](https://github.com/dcrlabs/neutrino-bch) and [neutrino-ltc](https://github.com/dcrlabs/neutrino-ltc) forks where changes needed by DCRDEX can be merged quickly. As of writing, they have fixes missing in their upstream repositories for LTC and BCH.

## Governance

In September the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 8,848 DCR worth $241K at September's average rate of $27.19. 3,089 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $84K at September's rate, or $99K at August's billing rate of $31.93. 

The [treasury spend transaction](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/c8a4d7fae86645449561a3b414ac7df0ea33b5de03e58ded345ad71c485c9c6b) was mined on August Sep 24, it had 28 outputs ranging from 1 DCR to 961 DCR. The transaction was approved with 6,856 Yes votes and 0 No votes.

As of Oct 10, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 817,745 DCR (20.9 million USD at $25.51).

There were no proposals published on Politeia in September, but a new PR [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/d5221a9) from @lindseymmc was published on Oct 1.

A [proposal idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/xd2ixd/partnership_between_fio_protocol_and_decred/) was posted on Reddit suggesting a partnership between FIO Protocol and Decred, it is not asking for funding but instead offering to pay an integration grant to whoever would do the work to integrate FIO within Decred software. FIO is an Interwallet Operability initiative with its own token.

An [update](https://proposals.decred.org/record/4475472) was posted on the Politeia proposal (missed in August) announcing that the site was updated to v1.4.0, with most of the work going into the importing of legacy Git backend proposals into Trillian, along with some new features like allowing edits to comments within 5 minutes of their posting.

OFAC has [clarified](https://home.treasury.gov/taxonomy/term/1546) how the sanctions against the Tornado Cash addresses are supposed to work.  The people who received unsolicited nominal sums from Tornado Cash (someone was trolling) are technically in breach of the sanctions but they can fill in a blocked property form to avoid prosecution.

Coinbase is [coming after](https://blockworks.co/coinbase-users-across-georgia-milk-price-bug-for-100x-profit/) Georgians who took advantage of a bug which saw the Georgian Lari mispriced for 7 hours and traders getting 100 times the Lari for their crypto. Coinbase contacted their banks and had their accounts locked pending clawback of the withdrawn funds.

Ethereum [completed](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/15/the-ethereum-merge-is-done-did-it-work/) "the merge" to switch from PoW to PoS consensus, cutting its energy use by an [estimated](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more) 99.95% and reducing the issuance rate of new ETH in the process. 

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed a [complaint](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8590-22) against Ooki DAO for violating the Commodity Exchange Act. A $250,000 penalty was imposed on bZeroX LLC, who tried to circumvent enforcement by decentralizing control of the protocol to Ooki DAO. Now the CFTC has indicated that they are coming after anyone who is involved in Ooki DAO, which it describes as an "Unincorporated Association". It [appears](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/11/fear-may-be-keeping-crypto-group-ooki-dao-from-mounting-defense-against-cftc/) that Ooki DAO token holders are afraid to vote on proposals about how to respond, lest they open themselves up to more individual trouble by voting, and there is a danger they may lose by default if the DAO does not respond by Oct 14. 

A merger between two DeFi communities (FEI and RARI) is being [dissolved](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/20/lessons-from-a-defi-dao-divorce/) after an acrimonious split over how to compensate victims of Fuse, a DeFi product of their shared venture which was hacked for $80 million. In the aftermath of the hack an initial governance proposal was approved to fully compensate all victims, but FEI's leadership (who had the funds to make victims whole) decided it wasn't a proper proposal and did not follow through. It took 4 proposals to reach a solution all parties could agree to, and it involved dissolving the partnership between the projects and giving token holders a way to exit.
