## DCRDEX v0.5 Released

DCRDEX v0.5.3 was the first publicly announced release in the v0.5 series, followed by v0.5.4 in October with a critical fix for all Bitcoin wallets.

v0.5 makes trading more accessible, stable, and convenient. Major changes since v0.4:

- Built-in lightweight DCR wallet. Using dcrwallet or Decrediton in SPV mode (not full node) was already supported, but now no external wallet software is even required to trade DCR. However, users should continue with their existing Decred wallet software that has all the governance features that makes Decred great.

- Trading BTC and LTC using Electrum wallets. Electrum wallets have weak privacy but they are very popular and easy to use so supporting them lowers the barrier for many.

- DCRDEX can now work with mixed account configurations when using dcrwallet or Decrediton as the external DCR wallet, allowing Decred's privacy features to be used automatically when trading.

- Swap options may be set at time of placement of each order rather than in the wallet settings. This includes pre-sizing funds to avoid overlocking of UTXOs, and specifying higher network fee rates.

- Improved send/withdraw controls, allowing a complete sweep of the wallet minus transaction fees, or sending a precise amount like most wallets.

- Bitcoin swap acceleration using CPFP transactions to increase the swap fee rate in the event of a network fee spike. This has not been in demand much recently, but we have encountered rapid increases in Bitcoin fee rates in the past where this is valuable.

- Fiat currency value display. When enabled by the user, current USD exchange rates for all assets will be used to show equivalent fiat values on the UI.

- QR code display for wallet receiving addresses.

- Rescan and recover functionality for the native BTC SPV wallet. You may also now reconfigure the native BTC wallet's "birthday" to change the scope of the rescan.

- Add the option to obtain Decred network fee rates from dcrdata when the client wallet is unable.

- Bitcoin "descriptor" wallets are now supported. This only applies to users of the Bitcoin Core software, not the native BTC wallet, who also choose to create this type of wallet that is becoming the default in future versions of Bitcoin Core.

- Support for the latest Litecoin Core software (v0.21) that introduced MWEB (private addresses). Note: regular addresses are used for trades.

- Initial Zcash (ZEC) support using zcashd and unshielded addresses for trading. Note: ZEC trading pairs are not yet live at dex.decred.org (but impatient server admins can try it).

- Experimental Windows build which starts the DEX client with no terminal, and with a system tray icon. For Windows users, this should feel more natural.

- Many other stability and quality of life improvements.

{ _Maybe split features in groups for easier reading and/or drop some items to shorten this section._ }

While DCRDEX is more complex compared to traditional exchanges, it is worth noting how accessible it is as a desktop app. DEX client is a single file that requires no installation. User interface quickly loads from local files. Builds are available for Windows, macOS, Linux (x64, ARM and RISC-V CPUs) and even FreeBSD and OpenBSD.

Check the [full release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases) for the full list of new features, fixes, and upgrading instructions. As of writing, the latest release is v0.5.4 and it comes with standalone binaries that can be used independently from Decrediton. As always, we recommend to [verify the files](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/verifying-binaries) before running.


## LTC Trading Enabled at dex.decred.org

{ image: New pairs https://twitter.com/DecredSociety/status/1575934440546574336 }

_Image: LTC pairs are live at dex.decred.org!_

{ Maybe use this too: https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1575900485864853504 }

Some users are naturally [confused](https://twitter.com/SoapboxBueller/status/1575909321136754688) by the two ways how an asset can be "supported" by DCRDEX:

1. A new asset is first added in "the code". This does not automatically add new trading pairs at the official server (dex.decred.org) and this stage is not visible to its end users. Code integration is still announced though as it's an important milestone and third party servers may start using it sooner.

2. After sufficient testing and preparation new pairs go live at the official server.

As of writing [dex.decred.org](https://dex.decred.org) supports trading of DCR, BTC and LTC. Third party server operators may enable additional experimental, currently supported: BCH, DOGE, ZEC, and ETH.


## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

September was mostly about optimization and cleanup:

- Optimized block template generation to not fetch [inputs for coinbase](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2994) transaction (one that mints new coins) because it cannot have inputs.
- [Optimized memory](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2993) used by transaction script copying. { _minor, maybe group in Optimizations_ }
- Restored [spend journal cleanup logic](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2997) when blocks are disconnected (it was removed as part of a larger cleanup). { _minor, maybe group in Fixes_ }
- Deprecated the [`--blockminsize`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3002) CLI option. It allowed to add low-fee or free transactions into a block while the block was below the specified minimum size. The policy allowing to relay such low-fee/free transactions was [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2964) (and replaced with the Child Pays For Parent technique) and so this CLI option is no longer needed.
- Reworked [UTXO cache](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2995) to improve its robustness, optimize it, and correct some hard to hit corner cases. This cache provides fast access to coins in circulation (aka Unspent Transaction Outputs - UTXO) and is essential for performance, because on a high level each block spends existing coins and creates new coins. Since it is consensus critical code, the rework was split into 19 independent changes to make it easier to review.
- Added a database migration to [remove UTXOs that cannot be spent](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2996). Specifically, coins created by the `treasurybase` transaction (the 10% part of the block reward that goes to treasury) are never directly spendable and thus should not take space in the UTXO database.
- Removed mempool and mining code dealing with [low-fee and free tx relay policy](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3003). Related `--blockprioritysize` option and fields in the `getrawmempool` response have been deprecated.
- Maintenance: refactoring { 3000 }, upgrades { 2992 } and cleanup { 2998 3001 3004 }


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

- Respect [proxy config](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2184) for SPV and P2P seeder connections.


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

- Upgraded [dcrdex module](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3791) to v0.5.2.
- Updated [German translation](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3798).
- Reused [media breakpoints](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3799) from the [pi-ui](https://github.com/decred/pi-ui/pull/459) library. This removes duplicate screen size definitions from 154 files and makes them consistent with Politeia GUI.


### Politeia

_[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia) is Decred's proposal system. It is used to request funding from the Decred treasury._

Backend:

- Added [v1.4.0 release notes](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1678) to documentation. { _minor_ }
- Fixed ordering of [proposal author updates](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1679).

GUI remake on the new [plugin architecture](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/tree/master/plugins-structure#politeiagui---plugins-structure):

- 4+ [mobile view](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2857) improvements for comments, markdown buttons, proposal page etc.
- Added [unit tests](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2840) for app initialization.
- Fixed [store errors](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2856) discovered with the new tests.

pi-ui library (shared by Politeia and Decrediton):

- Improved sizes in [mobile view](https://github.com/decred/pi-ui/pull/462).
- Fixed [double rendering](https://github.com/decred/pi-ui/pull/463) of modals.


### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software for running a Voting Service Provider. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

- Moved vspd code to [`cmd` direcctory](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/352). It is the final step of [removing global variables](https://github.com/decred/vspd/issues/339) and it allows to build multiple executables from a single repository.
- Made [database backups](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/353) optional. Backups are only required by vspd but not by test code or future upcoming tools (such as [vote validator](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/335)).


### Lightning Network

_[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant and low-cost transactions._

[Liquidity Provider Daemon](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnlpd):

- Changed [the policy for closing channels](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnlpd/pull/7) from an absolute policy (close all channels that don't meet the policy conditions) to a relative policy (based on activity scoring for each channel). The policy enforcement only kicks off after the on-chain wallet balance drops below a new config parameter. The intended result is that channels will not be closed unless the liquidity provider requires coins to fund new channels, preferring to close channels with a combination of low activity during its lifetime. This is a more useful policy in the current state of Decred's LN due to low rates of use.


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

Merged in v0.5.3 release:

- Added a [fallback API for getting fee info](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1695) from external sources. For Bitcoin RPC wallets (i.e. a local Bitcoin Core wallet) it will use [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/) API.
- Fixed swap/redemption [fee info](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1827) and added columns for base and quote fee assets to the CSV export.
- Fixed 4 [edge cases](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1849) with disconnection during trades and invalid responses from the server.
- Fixed candles [delta overflow](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1872) bug.
- Removed [default port](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/e9ca06d353c7aa1f66a120ac8b9b8a6cc021983e) for Electrum.
- Backported several [other fixes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1850) from `master`.

User-facing changes merged in `master`:

- Display [estimated fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1688) when withdrawing funds.
- Improved notifications for [placed orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1803).
- Added a button to [disable a wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1804).
- Added native [SPV wallet for Bitcoin Cash](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1635). "Native" means the wallet is fully managed by the DEX without the need to download/install/configure external software (the BCH wallet), while "SPV" means it works without downloading the BCH blockchain. This currently relies on a [temporary fork](https://github.com/buck54321/neutrino-bch) of [gcash/neutrino](https://github.com/gcash/neutrino) with extra changes needed by DCRDEX, until those changes are merged by the gcash project.
- Added native [SPV wallet for Litecoin](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1750), similar to one for BCH.
- Show [recently matched orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1663).
- Show [system tray icon](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1828) on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Fixed incorrect market [volume](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1837) on Wallets page. { minor? }
- Fixed confusing [ordering of trade steps](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1830) on the Order page and added display of future steps to expect.
- Other fixes { 1813 1843 1841 1855 1856 }

Internal changes merged in `master`:

- Replaced uses of `settxfee` method with a more robust [`fee_rate` argument](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1706) to `sendtoaddress`. It is only supported with recent versions of Bitcoin Core and its clones. Wallets based on older Bitcoin Core will continue to use `settxfee` (BCH, DOGE, ZEC).
- Added a tool for finding missing notification [translations](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1835). Also, notifications will fall back to English strings if a translation is missing.
- Clients will no longer accept signatures of [truncated messages](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1526) - a bug where in some places truncated message data was signed and verified without getting hashed first. The PR explains why this bug was hard to exploit but also quite tricky to fix. This change is the last step of the 4-stage plan to roll out the fix with minimum disruption to older clients.
- Other fixes { 1838 1846 1852 1860 1873 1876 }
- Code maintenance { 1836 1831 1859 1851 }
- Testing { 1742 }
- Documentation { 1842 1839 1824 }

Ethereum support:

- [Babysit](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1638) refund and redeem transactions. Unlike UTXO coins, Ethereum's ability to replace one transaction with another with the same nonce requires more involved tracking.
- Update [fees paid](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1752) after the transaction is mined. For Ethereum-based assets, the exact fee paid cannot be known in advance.

[dex.decred.org](https://dex.decred.org/) landing page:

- Rewritten [How to get started](https://github.com/decred/dexweb/pull/26) text.
- Added [nice icons](https://github.com/decred/dexweb/pull/27) for all 6 supported assets.

DCRDEX aims to support trading with lightweight wallets, which is a massive boost to user experience compared to having to download full blockchains. For Decred it uses its native SPV protocol and for Bitcoin it relies on the [Neutrino](https://github.com/lightninglabs/neutrino) wallet from Lightning Labs (which itself uses btcsuite). Neutrino forks for Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash are [not as well maintained](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1750#issuecomment-1201859406) however, so the team has created [neutrino-bch](https://github.com/dcrlabs/neutrino-bch) and [neutrino-ltc](https://github.com/dcrlabs/neutrino-ltc) forks where changes needed by DCRDEX can be merged quickly. As of writing, they have fixes missing in their upstream repositories for LTC and BCH.

### dcrdata

_[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata) is an explorer for Decred blockchain and off-chain data like Politeia proposals, markets, and more._

Known Issue:

- `treasurybases` and `treasuryadds` outputs are [not spendable](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/1932) and should be labeled as "Not Applicable" instead of "False". { _It is an bug report, not a PR, and the issue is quite minor. Maybe drop it._ }


### Documentation

_[dcrdocs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs) is the source code for Decred [user documentation](https://docs.decred.org/)._

- Decred's [Business Brief](https://docs.decred.org/getting-started/business-brief/) and [Project History](https://docs.decred.org/getting-started/project-history/) pages have been [moved](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1206) from the old Decred website to the "Getting Started" section of [docs.decred.org](https://docs.decred.org/).


### decred.org

_[dcrweb](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb) is the source code for the decred.org website._

Translations:

- Translations infrastrucure received a cleanup and a [GUI tool](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1058) to update translations ([pioneered](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3569) in Decrediton), along with usage [instructions](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1073).
- Added/updated [Chinese](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1067), [Arabic](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1068), [German](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1069), and [Polish](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1070) translations.

Exchanges:

- Removed [KuCoin](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1064) after it was observed to not accept DCR deposits (although it might be [added back](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/1087)).
- Removed [Huobi](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1081) due to their [delisting](https://www.huobi.com/support/en-us/detail/104917015223952) of privacy coins.

[Redirects](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1061) for moved/deleted pages:

- `/brief` and `/history` redirects to their new locations at [docs.decred.org](https://docs.decred.org/). 
- `/contributors` redirects to Decred's [GitHub org members](https://github.com/orgs/decred/people).
- Secure, Sustainable, and Adaptable pages have been removed and will show "Page not found" with a link to the home page.

Other:

- Added @richardred's [Blockchain Analysis Part 2](https://blockcommons.red/post/dcr-on-chain-2/) to [Press](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1066) coverage.
- Prevent page headings from [wrapping](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1065). { _minor fix_ }
- Fixes { 1072 }

In Progress:

- DCRDEX v0.5 [Press Release](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1085). { _not too notable for In Progress, drop_ }


### Other

[dcrwebapi](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi) (mainly used to get VSP information):

- Added [block height](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pull/167) and estimated network proportion to the VSP response. Unlike the last updated timestamp (currently shown at the [VSP list](https://decred.org/vsp/)), block height allows to more accurately determine if the VSP has stalled.
- Removed [unused endpoints](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pull/170). The one to get coin supply (`gcs`) is replaced by a better maintained [dcrdata API](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata#apis) (the `/supply` endpoint), while the download count (`dc`) was only a very rough estimate based on a quite basic heuristic. If you know anyone using these endpoints please report in [issue 169](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/issues/169).

Software translations:

- A [new status page](https://decredcommunity.github.io/translations/status) has been created to track how up-to-date are Decred software translations. Currently tracking Decrediton, DCRDEX and decred.org website.

## Governance

In September the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 8,848 DCR worth $241K at September's average rate of $27.19. 3,089 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $84K at September's rate, or $99K at August's billing rate of $31.93. 

The [treasury spend transaction](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/c8a4d7fae86645449561a3b414ac7df0ea33b5de03e58ded345ad71c485c9c6b) was mined on August Sep 24, it had 28 outputs ranging from 1 DCR to 961 DCR. The transaction was approved with 6,856 Yes votes and 0 No votes.

As of Oct 10, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 817,745 DCR (20.9 million USD at $25.51).

There were no proposals published on Politeia in September, but a new PR [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/d5221a9) from @lindseymmc was published on Oct 1.

A [proposal idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/xd2ixd/partnership_between_fio_protocol_and_decred/) was posted on Reddit suggesting a partnership between FIO Protocol and Decred, it is not asking for funding but instead offering to pay an integration grant to whoever would do the work to integrate FIO within Decred software. FIO is an Interwallet Operability initiative with its own token.

An [update](https://proposals.decred.org/record/4475472) was posted on the Politeia proposal (missed in August) announcing that the site was updated to v1.4.0, with most of the work going into the importing of legacy Git backend proposals into Trillian, along with some new features like allowing edits to comments within 5 minutes of their posting.


## Network

**Hashrate**: September's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=l796eq4a-l8vp7dzk&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) opened at ~82 Ph/s and closed ~91 Ph/s, bottoming at 75 Ph/s and peaking at 109 Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of 71 Ph/s hashrate [reported](https://poolbay.io/crypto/54/decred) by the pools on Oct 1: F2Pool 54%, Poolin 36%, BTC.com 6%, AntPool 3.6%, CoinMine 0.7%, unknown 0.3%.

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by Oct 1: F2Pool 49%, Poolin 44%, BTC.com 4%, (likely) AntPool 3%, CoinMine 0.3%.

_Image: Pool hashrate distribution._

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=l796eq4a-l8vp7dzk&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between 221-239 DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at 229.1 DCR (-1.1).

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=l796eq4a-l8vp7dzk&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) was 9.28-9.43 million DCR, meaning that 64.1-64.9% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=l796eq4a-l8vp7dzk&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) in Proof of Stake.

**VSP**: On Oct 1, ~7,820 (+770) live tickets were managed by [listed](https://decred.org/vsp/) vspd servers. Collectively the 18 VSPs managed 19.1% of the ticket pool (+1.8%).

Biggest gainers in September are vspd.bass.cf (+726) and vspd.stakey.com (+443).

Note that vspd.stakey.com had [API issues](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pull/171) since Sep 20 and its ticket count is inaccurate as of Oct 1.

## Events

**Attended:**

- Paul Rosenberg mentioned Decred at Hackers Congress Paralelni Polis (Prague, Czech Republic). It was a small appearnace on [one slide](https://twitter.com/cryptotnetennba/status/1575969203835715584) but with an important idea:

> BTC, BCH, Decred, Scrit, whatever.. **Use** it.  
> Start publishing prices in sats; let people learn how to convert.  
> Setup middlemen if you like.  
> Take a year to transition if necessary, but we must use our money.

On YouTube technical analysis for DCR has been made by [More Crypto Online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP1-Ie5jFzo) ("it is one of the best altcoin charts out there but there is no guarantee for it to work out"), [Jacob Crypto Bury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FopCO-7UiaA), and [Schulz & Team Analytik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=begoqsTKdOI&t=586s) (German).

OFAC has [clarified](https://home.treasury.gov/taxonomy/term/1546) how the sanctions against the Tornado Cash addresses are supposed to work.  The people who received unsolicited nominal sums from Tornado Cash (someone was trolling) are technically in breach of the sanctions but they can fill in a blocked property form to avoid prosecution.

Coinbase is [coming after](https://blockworks.co/coinbase-users-across-georgia-milk-price-bug-for-100x-profit/) Georgians who took advantage of a bug which saw the Georgian Lari mispriced for 7 hours and traders getting 100 times the Lari for their crypto. Coinbase contacted their banks and had their accounts locked pending clawback of the withdrawn funds.

Ethereum [completed](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/15/the-ethereum-merge-is-done-did-it-work/) "the merge" to switch from PoW to PoS consensus, cutting its energy use by an [estimated](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more) 99.95% and reducing the issuance rate of new ETH in the process. 

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed a [complaint](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8590-22) against Ooki DAO for violating the Commodity Exchange Act. A $250,000 penalty was imposed on bZeroX LLC, who tried to circumvent enforcement by decentralizing control of the protocol to Ooki DAO. Now the CFTC has indicated that they are coming after anyone who is involved in Ooki DAO, which it describes as an "Unincorporated Association". It [appears](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/11/fear-may-be-keeping-crypto-group-ooki-dao-from-mounting-defense-against-cftc/) that Ooki DAO token holders are afraid to vote on proposals about how to respond, lest they open themselves up to more individual trouble by voting, and there is a danger they may lose by default if the DAO does not respond by Oct 14. 

A merger between two DeFi communities (FEI and RARI) is being [dissolved](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/20/lessons-from-a-defi-dao-divorce/) after an acrimonious split over how to compensate victims of Fuse, a DeFi product of their shared venture which was hacked for $80 million. In the aftermath of the hack an initial governance proposal was approved to fully compensate all victims, but FEI's leadership (who had the funds to make victims whole) decided it wasn't a proper proposal and did not follow through. It took 4 proposals to reach a solution all parties could agree to, and it involved dissolving the partnership between the projects and giving token holders a way to exit.
