## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover its most notable dev work._
- _For each project, the order of reporting is "most released first": changes released to end users, merged to master, in progress (work started), discussions and future plans._
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

}


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commits/master }

- Modified the method that [prunes expired transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3042) from the mempool to accept the current best height as opposed to looking it up internally. This is part of a bigger effort to make mempool state easier to reason about by removing hidden assumptions.
- Updated the [Docker image](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3043) to newer versions of Go and Alpine Linux.
- Configured the Docker container to [forward SIGTERM signal](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3044) to the running dcrd instance so it shuts down gracefully when a container is stopped.
- Improved and extended [Docker documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3045).
- Updated JSON-RPC [API docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3046) to remove usages of the deprecated `ioutil` package. { _minor, merge_ }
- Added a [missing break](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3047) after selecting a random address from the Address Manager. {_minor, merge into bullet below_ }
- Optimized selection of peers in the address manager to mitigate [high CPU use](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3047) discovered by testing the DEX with an SPV DCR wallet.


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commits/master }

- Added a [watchlast option](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2196) to limit initially watched addresses, which in turn improves startup resource usage and performance. This will benefit very large wallets with many old addresses that are not expected to be used again.


### Politeia

_[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia) is Decred's proposal system. It is used to request funding from the Decred treasury._

{ _Check these repos:_

- https://github.com/decred/politeia/commits/master
- https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/commits/master
- https://github.com/decred/pi-ui/commits/master

}

All changes below are towards the GUI remake on the new [plugin architecture](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/tree/master/plugins-structure#politeiagui---plugins-structure).

Re-implemented pages:

- [User Details](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2884) page (with 7 tabs). All visual feedbacks, modals, and messages have been refactored, common UI elements extracted for reuse, several UI and responsiveness issues fixed, minor design improvements.
- [User session pages](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2887), including Signup, Login, Logout, Password Reset, and Verify Email.
- [Admin pages](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2891) for Unvetted Proposals and Search for Users.
- [Proposal pages](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2892) including Edit and Raw view.
- There is a [master issue](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/2875) tracking which pages have been reimplemented.

Other changes:

- Refactored the high-level Politeia app to use the new [toolkit](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2881) for wiring the plugins together.
- Added [validation](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2889) to all forms on Politeia, including error messages, and form submission control.
- ~3 fixes { 2888 x2, 2890 } and { 475, 476 } fixes in the pi-ui library.

### cspp

_[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp) is a server for coordinating coin mixes using the CoinShuffle++ protocol. It is non-custodial, i.e. does not hold any funds._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/cspp/commits/master }

- Capture IP address and message type when [sending to client fails](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/79).
- Fixed a [protocol bug](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/80) which caused signature validation failures if the client and server used different sizes of the integer type, such as a 32-bit client connecting to a 64-bit server.
- Updated to [latest](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/81) dcrd modules.


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

{ _Check these repos:_

- https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commits/master
- https://github.com/decred/dexweb/commits/master

}

Client changes:

- Updated [web dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1996).
- Updated Docker config: [optimized base images](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2030), switched DEX client to [run as non-root user](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2035), and [excluded unneeded files](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2077). Among other things it helps to integrate the DEX client into Umbrel. { prop link }
- Allow to [acknowledge and hide](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2044) the warning to keep the DEX client running until all trades settle.
- Improved checkbox UX with [uniform style](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2002) across all forms.
- Show [which wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2071) is missing if it was not found on startup.
- Added consistent [border](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2070) to all input fields, drop downs, and checkboxes.
- Save some [user preferences](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1975) across page switches/refreshes and DEX client restarts. Things like hide/show left market dock or select chosen wallet on the Wallets page.
- Show base assets in [superscript](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2089) in the market header. { _minor, merge or drop_ }

Client fixes:

- Fixed confusing [sync progress](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2008) jumps after disconnecting from all SPV peers.
- Improved detection and handling of refund transactions that were [broadcast manually](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2011) outside of the DEX client.
- Fixed launch failure on [32-bit systems](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2031).
- Fixed directory paths that blocked built-in SPV wallets created in v0.5 from upgrading in the upcoming v0.6.
- Fixed creation of [Decred SPV](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2093) wallet over RPC. { _minor, merge_ }
- Fixed { 2082 2083 2079 } data races and { 2078 } deadlocks in the client. { _maybe present collectively as 'concurrency bugs'_ }

Server fixes:

- Avoid a [deadlock](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2021) after receiving maker's redeem ack.
- Added a sanity check to never send [swaps with zero fee rate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2060).

Other changes:

- Updated the [Fundamentals](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2001) spec page.
- Moved [compatibility checks](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2052) to `dex/networks` package. { _minor, merge_ }
- https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2061 { _minor, drop_ }

Ethereum:

- Removed the [recently added](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2047) `authrpc` interface. It was found to be [unnecessarily limiting](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2016#issuecomment-1369091909) by not having methods to inspect the mempool and calculate the most recent balance. At the same time not much was gained from using it in the DEX. For DEX use cases, it makes more sense to connect to Geth with either IPC or `--http` / `--ws`. In the future, authenticated RPC support may still be needed for getting Ethereum data from trusted third party RPC providers. This could greatly simplify testing because running Ethereum full node is [too difficult](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2020#discussion_r1081309070).
- Always check [block header timestamp](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2034) to determine sync status. Since Ethereum's "Merge" event, Geth will report the current block and highest block as the same number, so the difference between them can no longer be used to determine sync progress. Instead, DEX will compare last block header time to user's system clock, and if the block is old enough the chain will be assumed as not synced.
- Improved display of [Maker Redemption](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1978) in cases when the exact transaction is not known.
- Added DEX server ability to connect to Geth over [HTTP and WebSocket](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2047) interfaces.
- Added [timeouts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2051) to RPC requests so that very long requests to RPC providers could expire and be cancelled.
- Do not consider pending (unmined) transactions when calculating balance if the RPC provider lacks the [required methods](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2059) to do so.
- Only check [swap fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2062) after they get some confirmations (speed optimization).
- Fixed wallet config [not being saved](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2055) after the Reconfigure operation.
- Fixed missing [Settings button](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2053) for ERC-20 tokens.
- Fixed min/max [fee estimates](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2057) shown for swaps with "token" assets. Fees for swapping tokens are paid in base asset. For example, when buying DCR for USDC, fees for the USDC side of the trade are paid in ETH.

In progress:

- [DigiByte](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1993) (DGB) support.

## Governance

{ _Hint: Currently this is a mix of finances and governance. We may add the separate Finances section in the future._ }

In January the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 8,564 DCR worth $189K at January's average rate of $22.05. 

The [treasury spend tx](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/49f141f51421a499d319bc617a4430f87db3a73ffa605dee8408eefb081bd11b) mined on Jan 3 had 24 outputs and was reported last month as making payments to contractors for (mostly) the November invoices, ranging from 5 DCR to 1,270 DCR. It was approved by 6,967 votes (all Yes) and voter turnout of 54%, out of the 12,909 tickets that had a chance to participate during the shortened 9-day vote.

{ _^ we mentioned this tspend in 202212 but adding here with more detail since it was mined on Jan 3, plus it adds some clarity on the process. actually we have 2 events to report on: tspend published for voting and tspend mined, going forward we can tweak wording to reflect that precisely_ }

The treasury spend tx {in the mempool, enter details near publication} will pay for most of December's invoices.

{} DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth ${} at January's rate, or ${} at December's billing rate of $19.79.

The [treasury spend tx]({}) had {} outputs making payments to contractors, ranging from {} DCR to {} DCR. { _in case we have other tspend activity in Jan, cover it too but specify which event (published for voting or mined) }

{ _Other interesting facts/stories about the legacy or new treasury._ }

As of {date}, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is {n} DCR ({n} million USD at ${n.nn}).

{ _High-level recap of decision-making activity and most important events._ }

There were eight proposals published on Politeia in January.

- The [Decred Video Content 2023](https://proposals.decred.org/record/56a439a) proposal requested a budget of $45,600 to continue producing video content, including @Decred Society's "Decred and the state of the market" livestream, @Exitus' News Updates, @Karamble's video/gif animations @Tivra's Twitter spaces. It was approved with 83% Yes votes and 55% turnout.
- The [Decred Arabia Communications and Content 2023](https://proposals.decred.org/record/5b975ba) proposal requested a budget of $13,000 to continue the team's efforts for another year, it was approved with 75% Yes votes and 49% turnout.
- The [DCRDEX integration on Umbrel](https://proposals.decred.org/record/8d83046) proposal requested a budget of $1,960 to integrate DCRDEX with Umbrel, a remote server admin suite, making it much easier for Umbrel users to install DCRDEX. The proposal was approved with 84% Yes votes and 47% turnout.

## Network

{ _Hint: "Network" tracks key "health" metrics of the fundamental infrastructure._ }

{ _Hint: n, n.n, and n.nn tell how many decimals to keep, e.g. 100, 16.5, 8.63_ }

**Hashrate**: January's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of {} Ph/s hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

{ _Hint: Fallback links for pool distribution: https://poolbay.io/crypto/54/decred , https://dcrstats.com/pow ._ }

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between {n}-{n} DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}).

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, meaning that {n.n}-{n.n}% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) in Proof of Stake.

{ _Add a recap of ticket price action if it was interesting._ }

**VSP**: The [{} listed VSPs](https://decred.org/vsp/) collectively managed ~{n} (+{n}) live tickets, which was {n.n}% of the ticket pool (+{n.n}%) as of {date}.

{ _Optional: mention biggest gainers_ }

**Nodes**: [Decred Mapper](https://nodes.jholdstock.uk/user_agents) observed {} dcrd nodes on {date}: v{} - {n}%, ...

{ _Optional_ } The share of [mixed coins](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&zoom=jz3q237o-la8vk000&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true-true-true) varied between {n.n}-{n.n}%. Daily [mixed amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=privacy-participation&bin=day&axis=time) varied between {n}-{n}K DCR.

{ _Optional_ } Decred's [Lightning Network](https://ln-map.jholdstock.uk/) explorer has seen {} nodes (+{}), {} channels (+{}) with a total capacity of {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}), as of {date}.

{ _Add any interesting analysis or events in the network._ }


## Ecosystem

{ _Hint: "Ecosystem" is about new units of infrastructure or updates from existing: VSPs, exchanges, wallets, OTC desks, payment processors, investors. It is more about user-facing services, businesses, and wider adoption, while Network is more about the backbone. Use bullets or paragraphs, whatever looks best._ }

{ _Check https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/commits/master for changes to the VSP list._ }

{ _Check https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pulls for new VSPs under review._ }

{ _Check #ecosystem room for news._ }

{ _Check https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/commits/master for added/removed services._ }

- Removed the [GoDCR SPV wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1104) from the [Wallets page](https://decred.org/wallets/). Download links are no longer working and this wallet is no longer supported/updated as result of the [GoDCR proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/0ef42e5) failing to pass. [Source code](https://github.com/planetdecred/godcr) is still available.

}

The Ordinals protocol, for "inscribing" data on a Satoshsi like a Bitcoin version of an NFT, debuted this month and [received](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/31/bitcoin-community-erupts-in-existential-debate-over-nft-project-ordinals/) a mixed reaction from the Bitcoin community. Reactions were split between those who viewed it as an additional fun use case for Bitcoin, and those who saw it as spam invading the Bitcoin chain which should be discouraged or even censored. Adam back was among those who immediately started thinking of ways that mining pools could mobilise to censor and prevent this use of Bitcoin, although later deleted and [retracted](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1620005172058669056) the tweet. 

In early Feb the largest ever Bitcoin transaction was [mined](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/02/giant-bitcoin-taproot-wizard-nft-minted-in-collaboration-with-luxor-mining-pool/) and it was a "Taproot Wizard" Ordinal inscription, filling an entire block almost to the 4mb limit. The transaction was mined by Luxor pool and paid for in a private arrangement with Udi Wertheimer, one of the Taproot Wizards. Ordinals rely on Taproot and also Segwit to work in their specific form on the Bitcoin chain, and they have some structural differences to how NFTs work on Ethereum and other chains. 

Taproot itself has been [billed](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/privacyweek/2022/01/24/bitcoin-isnt-private-but-its-recent-taproot-upgrade-will-help/) as a privacy upgrade for Bitcoin, because it allows complex transactions, like those requiring multi-signature authorisation or using time locks, to appear similar to normal transactions, in a way which does not reveal their nature. Taproot also allows some of these operations to be completed more efficiently, which means paying less for block space. Although Taproot has been live since a soft fork activated in November 2021, its usage [remained low](https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/taproot-adoption-remains-low-but-devs-say-it-isnt-problem-for-bitcoin.htm) until recently, with only 0.37% of transactions using it in April 

Polkadot is planning to [transform](https://polkadot.network/blog/lets-talk-polkadot-opengov-part-i) its governance, aiming to improve the level of decentralization and community participation. Presently a Council is elected by token holders and appoints a Technical Committee of protocol experts, these bodies serve pivotal roles in Polkadot's governance. The new system will dissolve the Council and Committee roles. Some of their functions will be performed by community members directly, proposals will be submitted to different tracks depending on what they do, and the tracks will have their own approval thresholds and time frames, with an automated process to determine when voting starts and stops and which proposals are activated first. A "Substrate Fellowship" will take on the responsibility for assuring code quality for upgrades, but at 100+ members this will be a much larger group than the Technical Committee. The new governance system will also enable more flexible delegation of voting power, on a per proposal type basis.

Polkadot's Web3 Foundation has [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Web3foundation/status/1618550186166620161) out its argument for why the DOT token is no longer a security, [explaining](https://cointelegraph.com/news/polkadot-restates-its-case-that-dot-has-morphed-away-from-security-status) the efforts they have taken to comply with US securities laws and announcing in Nov 2022 that DOT was able to morph into something which was no longer a security.

It looks like Ooki DAO is [set](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ooki-dao-misses-lawsuit-response-deadline-default-judgment-on-the-cards) to lose its case with the CFTC in a default judgment because nobody stepped up to represent the DAO by the deadline of Jan 11. So far CFTC has established that it can [serve](https://cointelegraph.com/news/judge-orders-cftc-to-serve-ooki-dao-founders-with-lawsuit) a DAO papers by posting it on their forum/discord as long as they identify and serve at least one tokenholder as well, and has indicated that it considers anyone who participates in the DAO in any way to be jointly liable for its actions as an unincorporated partnership.

The SEC has [piled](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-13) on to Avi Eisenberg adding its own Mango market manipulation charges to those brought by the DoJ and CFTC already.  As of early Feb Eisenberg was [trying](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/02/alleged-mango-markets-exploiter-eisenberg-waives-bail-in-first-ny-court-hearing/) to negotiate bail, having been in custody since Dec 26. 

The infamous 3AC co-founders are [attempting](https://vulcanpost.com/814224/three-arrows-capital-seeks-funding-gtx-fill-ftx-void/) a rebirth from the ashes of FTX, seeking funding to set up a company for trading the claims that crypto traders have on bankrupt exchange liquidations. 

DeFi platform Moonwell on the Moonbeam chain has been [figuring](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/explanation-of-methodology-to-calculate-the-impact-of-mip-14-on-moonwell-users/351) out how to compensate its users after a voter-approved parameter change caused all the collateral on the platform to lose 99.9% of its borrowing power and everyone got liquidated, paying 10% of their position size in penalties. 30% of the liquidation penalties went to a community fund and a proposal will be made to reimburse that portion directly, the other 70% will be covered by Gauntlet, a risk management [partner](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlet-and-moonwell-partner-to-offer-dynamic-risk-management-259856b6146c) of Moonwell.

Reddit has launched some new use cases for MOONs, the /r/cryptocurrency karmic rewards token. Moonplace is a series of 10,000 NFTs which each grant their holder control of a 10x10 array of pixels in a 2d public [space](https://moonplace.io/). After 4 days all the NFTs had been minted, burning 1 million MOONs (worth ~$130,000) and causing a temporary spike in the price of MOONs. The Moonplace NFTs are on the Arbitrum Nova network, an L2 rollup scaling solution for Ethereum.

The first /r/cryptocurrency banner ad was also [sold](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/10q99w7/elite_darkweb_hacker_group_1inch_just_hacked_the/) for MOONs (worth $3,350), to the 1inch decentralized exchange.

The largest ETH staking pools have been [considering](https://twitter.com/nixorokish/status/1620061177551417349) whether they should limit their further growth to avoid issues of centralization. Rocket Pool is on course to approve a [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/rocketpool-dao.eth/proposal/0x9e093dea49dee9d1b3e43dbb6e0d8735149c5fde6ef703620970129b81d0f7f8) (RPIP-17) which would enshrine the objective for Rocket Pool to promote "healthy staking", with a couple of mechanisms to limit the growth in its share of pooled ETH staking, of which Rocket Pool currently controls 1.66%. Lido, which controls a much greater share of ETH staking (29%), overwhelmingly [rejected](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x10abedcc563b66b1adee60825e78c387105110fa4a1e7354ab57bc9cc1e675c2) a similar kind of proposal in July 2022.

Uniswap's governance has turned into a [clash](https://www.theblock.co/post/207297/uniswap-temperature-check-spurs-feverish-backroom-maneuvering-among-crypto-vc-heavyweights) of VCs as a16z and Jump are both backing their own book in a choice of which bridge to integrate for Binance Smart Chain. Jump is supporting Wormhole, and a16z's horse is LayerZero, but the twist is that a16z are technically unable to participate in the "temperature check" vote to decide which integration is coded up, but have asked that their 15M tokens be counted off the books as voting for LayerZero. Wormhole won the temperature check by 11M votes, so a16z's votes would be enough to change the outcome. Failing that, a16z could attempt to block the deployment of the Wormhole bridge by voting against it in an on chain vote (presuming they will be technically able to).

Silvergate Capital is the bank which many crypto exchanges use, and its stock has [plunged](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/01/05/silvergate-cuts-40-jobs-writes-off-diem-asset-acquisition/) by 46% after it reported outflows of $8.1 billion in crypto assets in Q2 2022, and cut 40% of its staff (about 200 employees) to cut costs. Silvergate was viewed as a possible casualty from the FTX/Genesis contagion, spurring the run of withdrawals. Silvergate also announced that it was writing off all $196 million of its investment in Diem (formerly Facebook Libra/Zuck Bucks), having apparently realised that open source code and a tarnished brand wasn't worth much.

Aptos, which is led by former Diem developers but didn't pay Meta/Silvergate anything for their assets and instead [took](https://siliconangle.com/2022/03/15/aptos-raises-200m-bring-diem-blockchain-back-life/) $200M funding from a16z and other VCs, saw a surge in its price in January which took its market cap to $2.4B, as it became the "[hot new coin](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-market-january-roundup-aptos-224447055.html)" for a period. 

Well known Bitcoin developer lukedashjr was [hacked](https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1609655629903265795) and lost a considerable proportion of his BTC stack, over 200 BTC. It appears that hackers were able to compromise the Linux system being used, which granted access to lukedashjr's PGP encryption keys as well as his BTC. The PGP keys were used to sign Bitcoin Core and Knots releases, so these should be distrusted by users until the situation is resolved and lukedashjr presumably publishes a new PGP key.

Youtube personality Logan Paul's role in the CryptoZoo NFT project was [documented](https://www.vulture.com/2023/01/logan-paul-cryptozoo-scam-coffeezilla-allegations-explained.html) by Coffeezilla, with the conclusion that he was chief among scammers for a project which over-hyped a game that they were not realistically going to deliver. Paul threatened to sue CoffeeZilla but then [withdrew](https://cointelegraph.com/news/logan-paul-backflips-on-defamation-lawsuit-against-coffeezilla-apologizes) those threats and apologized. Logan Paul is now the [subject](https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/news-coffeezilla-reveals-class-action-lawsuit-filed-logan-paul-role-cryptozoo) of a class action lawsuit over his role in CryptoZoo.

Vitalik Buterin has [published](https://vitalik.ca/general/2023/01/20/stealth.html) a blog post about stealth addresses, describing privacy as one of the largest remaining challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem. Stealth addresses would be generated by the sender from a recipient's meta-address, which only the recipient could control but which would not be associated with their on chain identity. In other words it would give the same kind of privacy as generating a new address for each receipt of assets, but without the hassle of having to generate the new addresses.
