## { Some Announcement }

{ _Add individual sections for high-impact announcements, such as consensus votes, software releases, milestones, major bugs, etc._ }


## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover its most notable dev work._
- _For each project, the order of reporting is "most released first": changes released to end users, merged to master, in progress (work started), discussions and future plans._
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

}


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commits/master }

- Optimized the [Address Manager](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3047) by setting a minimum value to mitigate excessive CPU usage when the number of attempts for a 'KnownAddress' became too large.
- Added a [missing break](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3047) after selecting a random address from the Address Manager.
- No longer use the [ioutil package](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3046), which is deprecated since Go 1.16.
- Finished [docker documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3045).
- Modified the 'entrypoint' [app signals](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3044) used by the Docker image to forward 'SIGTERM' to the running instance so it shuts down gracefully when a container is stopped.
- Updated the [docker image](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3043) to golang:1.19.5-alpine3.17.
- Modified the method that [prunes](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3042) expired mempool transactions to accept the current best height as opposed to looking it up internally.


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commits/master }

- Added a [watchlast option](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2196) to limit initially watched addresses, which in turn improves startup resource usage and performance.

Very large wallets have many addresses that may not be needed anymore,
but these addresses were always being loaded into the address
transaction filters. The watchlast option counts backwards from the current address index of every HD account branch, and ignores loading addresses prior to the cutoff during the initial sync.


### dcrctl

_[dcrctl](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl) is a command-line client for dcrd and dcrwallet._

{ _Hint: dcrctl is pulling most of the code from dcrd and dcrwallet. Often there is not much to report and this section can be removed._ }

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/commits/master }

- No longer using the [deprecated ioutil package](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/pull/53) as all functionality
from "io/ioutil" has been moved to either the "io" or "os" packages as of go 1.1.6



### Politeia

## Governance

{ _Hint: Currently this is a mix of finances and governance. We may add the separate Finances section in the future._ }

In January the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 8,564 DCR worth $189K at January's average rate of $22.05. 

The [treasury spend tx](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/49f141f51421a499d319bc617a4430f87db3a73ffa605dee8408eefb081bd11b) mined on Jan 3 had 24 outputs and was reported last month as making payments to contractors for (mostly) the November invoices, ranging from 5 DCR to 1,270 DCR. It was approved by 6,967 votes (all Yes) and voter turnout of 54%, out of the 12,909 tickets that had a chance to participate during the shortened 9-day vote.

{ _^ we mentioned this tspend in 202212 but adding here with more detail since it was mined on Jan 3, plus it adds some clarity on the process. actually we have 2 events to report on: tspend published for voting and tspend mined, going forward we can tweak wording to reflect that precisely_ }

The treasury spend tx {in the mempool, enter details near publication} will pay for most of December's invoices.

{} DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth ${} at January's rate, or ${} at December's billing rate of $19.79.

The [treasury spend tx]({}) had {} outputs making payments to contractors, ranging from {} DCR to {} DCR. { _in case we have other tspend activity in Jan, cover it too but specify which event (published for voting or mined) }

{ _Other interesting facts/stories about the legacy or new treasury._ }

As of {date}, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is {n} DCR ({n} million USD at ${n.nn}).

{ _High-level recap of decision-making activity and most important events._ }

There were eight proposals published on Politeia in January.

- The [Decred Video Content 2023](https://proposals.decred.org/record/56a439a) proposal requested a budget of $45,600 to continue producing video content, including @Decred Society's "Decred and the state of the market" livestream, @Exitus' News Updates, @Karamble's video/gif animations @Tivra's Twitter spaces. It was approved with 83% Yes votes and 55% turnout.
- The [Decred Arabia Communications and Content 2023](https://proposals.decred.org/record/5b975ba) proposal requested a budget of $13,000 to continue the team's efforts for another year, it was approved with 75% Yes votes and 49% turnout.
- The [DCRDEX integration on Umbrel](https://proposals.decred.org/record/8d83046) proposal requested a budget of $1,960 to integrate DCRDEX with Umbrel, a remote server admin suite, making it much easier for Umbrel users to install DCRDEX. The proposal was approved with 84% Yes votes and 47% turnout.

## Network

{ _Hint: "Network" tracks key "health" metrics of the fundamental infrastructure._ }

{ _Hint: n, n.n, and n.nn tell how many decimals to keep, e.g. 100, 16.5, 8.63_ }

**Hashrate**: January's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of {} Ph/s hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

{ _Hint: Fallback links for pool distribution: https://poolbay.io/crypto/54/decred , https://dcrstats.com/pow ._ }

- Check for good Taproot stories again, we can plug some edu if there are any. Drop if no recent news.

- Taproot is part of the Ordinals NFT on Bitcoin story: https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/31/bitcoin-community-erupts-in-existential-debate-over-nft-project-ordinals/

}

The Ordinals protocol, for "inscribing" data on a Satoshsi like a Bitcoin version of an NFT, debuted this month and [received](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/31/bitcoin-community-erupts-in-existential-debate-over-nft-project-ordinals/) a mixed reaction from the Bitcoin community. Reactions were split between those who viewed it as an additional fun use case for Bitcoin, and those who saw it as spam invading the Bitcoin chain which should be discouraged or even censored. Adam back was among those who immediately started thinking of ways that mining pools could mobilise to censor and prevent this use of Bitcoin, although later deleted and [retracted](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1620005172058669056) the tweet. 

In early Feb the largest ever Bitcoin transaction was [mined](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/02/giant-bitcoin-taproot-wizard-nft-minted-in-collaboration-with-luxor-mining-pool/) and it was a "Taproot Wizard" Ordinal inscription, filling an entire block almost to the 4mb limit. The transaction was mined by Luxor pool and paid for in a private arrangement with Udi Wertheimer, one of the Taproot Wizards. Ordinals rely on Taproot and also Segwit to work in their specific form on the Bitcoin chain, and they have some structural differences to how NFTs work on Ethereum and other chains. 

Taproot itself has been [billed](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/privacyweek/2022/01/24/bitcoin-isnt-private-but-its-recent-taproot-upgrade-will-help/) as a privacy upgrade for Bitcoin, because it allows complex transactions, like those requiring multi-signature authorisation or using time locks, to appear similar to normal transactions, in a way which does not reveal their nature. Taproot also allows some of these operations to be completed more efficiently, which means paying less for block space. Although Taproot has been live since a soft fork activated in November 2021, its usage [remained low](https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/taproot-adoption-remains-low-but-devs-say-it-isnt-problem-for-bitcoin.htm) until recently, with only 0.37% of transactions using it in April 

Polkadot is planning to [transform](https://polkadot.network/blog/lets-talk-polkadot-opengov-part-i) its governance, aiming to improve the level of decentralization and community participation. Presently a Council is elected by token holders and appoints a Technical Committee of protocol experts, these bodies serve pivotal roles in Polkadot's governance. The new system will dissolve the Council and Committee roles. Some of their functions will be performed by community members directly, proposals will be submitted to different tracks depending on what they do, and the tracks will have their own approval thresholds and time frames, with an automated process to determine when voting starts and stops and which proposals are activated first. A "Substrate Fellowship" will take on the responsibility for assuring code quality for upgrades, but at 100+ members this will be a much larger group than the Technical Committee. The new governance system will also enable more flexible delegation of voting power, on a per proposal type basis.

Polkadot's Web3 Foundation has [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Web3foundation/status/1618550186166620161) out its argument for why the DOT token is no longer a security, [explaining](https://cointelegraph.com/news/polkadot-restates-its-case-that-dot-has-morphed-away-from-security-status) the efforts they have taken to comply with US securities laws and announcing in Nov 2022 that DOT was able to morph into something which was no longer a security.

It looks like Ooki DAO is [set](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ooki-dao-misses-lawsuit-response-deadline-default-judgment-on-the-cards) to lose its case with the CFTC in a default judgment because nobody stepped up to represent the DAO by the deadline of Jan 11. So far CFTC has established that it can [serve](https://cointelegraph.com/news/judge-orders-cftc-to-serve-ooki-dao-founders-with-lawsuit) a DAO papers by posting it on their forum/discord as long as they identify and serve at least one tokenholder as well, and has indicated that it considers anyone who participates in the DAO in any way to be jointly liable for its actions as an unincorporated partnership.

The SEC has [piled](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-13) on to Avi Eisenberg adding its own Mango market manipulation charges to those brought by the DoJ and CFTC already.  As of early Feb Eisenberg was [trying](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/02/alleged-mango-markets-exploiter-eisenberg-waives-bail-in-first-ny-court-hearing/) to negotiate bail, having been in custody since Dec 26. 

The infamous 3AC co-founders are [attempting](https://vulcanpost.com/814224/three-arrows-capital-seeks-funding-gtx-fill-ftx-void/) a rebirth from the ashes of FTX, seeking funding to set up a company for trading the claims that crypto traders have on bankrupt exchange liquidations. 

DeFi platform Moonwell on the Moonbeam chain has been [figuring](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/explanation-of-methodology-to-calculate-the-impact-of-mip-14-on-moonwell-users/351) out how to compensate its users after a voter-approved parameter change caused all the collateral on the platform to lose 99.9% of its borrowing power and everyone got liquidated, paying 10% of their position size in penalties. 30% of the liquidation penalties went to a community fund and a proposal will be made to reimburse that portion directly, the other 70% will be covered by Gauntlet, a risk management [partner](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlet-and-moonwell-partner-to-offer-dynamic-risk-management-259856b6146c) of Moonwell.

Reddit has launched some new use cases for MOONs, the /r/cryptocurrency karmic rewards token. Moonplace is a series of 10,000 NFTs which each grant their holder control of a 10x10 array of pixels in a 2d public [space](https://moonplace.io/). After 4 days all the NFTs had been minted, burning 1 million MOONs (worth ~$130,000) and causing a temporary spike in the price of MOONs. The Moonplace NFTs are on the Arbitrum Nova network, an L2 rollup scaling solution for Ethereum.

The first /r/cryptocurrency banner ad was also [sold](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/10q99w7/elite_darkweb_hacker_group_1inch_just_hacked_the/) for MOONs (worth $3,350), to the 1inch decentralized exchange.

The largest ETH staking pools have been [considering](https://twitter.com/nixorokish/status/1620061177551417349) whether they should limit their further growth to avoid issues of centralization. Rocket Pool is on course to approve a [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/rocketpool-dao.eth/proposal/0x9e093dea49dee9d1b3e43dbb6e0d8735149c5fde6ef703620970129b81d0f7f8) (RPIP-17) which would enshrine the objective for Rocket Pool to promote "healthy staking", with a couple of mechanisms to limit the growth in its share of pooled ETH staking, of which Rocket Pool currently controls 1.66%. Lido, which controls a much greater share of ETH staking (29%), overwhelmingly [rejected](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x10abedcc563b66b1adee60825e78c387105110fa4a1e7354ab57bc9cc1e675c2) a similar kind of proposal in July 2022.

Uniswap's governance has turned into a [clash](https://www.theblock.co/post/207297/uniswap-temperature-check-spurs-feverish-backroom-maneuvering-among-crypto-vc-heavyweights) of VCs as a16z and Jump are both backing their own book in a choice of which bridge to integrate for Binance Smart Chain. Jump is supporting Wormhole, and a16z's horse is LayerZero, but the twist is that a16z are technically unable to participate in the "temperature check" vote to decide which integration is coded up, but have asked that their 15M tokens be counted off the books as voting for LayerZero. Wormhole won the temperature check by 11M votes, so a16z's votes would be enough to change the outcome. Failing that, a16z could attempt to block the deployment of the Wormhole bridge by voting against it in an on chain vote (presuming they will be technically able to).

Silvergate Capital is the bank which many crypto exchanges use, and its stock has [plunged](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/01/05/silvergate-cuts-40-jobs-writes-off-diem-asset-acquisition/) by 46% after it reported outflows of $8.1 billion in crypto assets in Q2 2022, and cut 40% of its staff (about 200 employees) to cut costs. Silvergate was viewed as a possible casualty from the FTX/Genesis contagion, spurring the run of withdrawals. Silvergate also announced that it was writing off all $196 million of its investment in Diem (formerly Facebook Libra/Zuck Bucks), having apparently realised that open source code and a tarnished brand wasn't worth much.

Aptos, which is led by former Diem developers but didn't pay Meta/Silvergate anything for their assets and instead [took](https://siliconangle.com/2022/03/15/aptos-raises-200m-bring-diem-blockchain-back-life/) $200M funding from a16z and other VCs, saw a surge in its price in January which took its market cap to $2.4B, as it became the "[hot new coin](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-market-january-roundup-aptos-224447055.html)" for a period. 

Well known Bitcoin developer lukedashjr was [hacked](https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1609655629903265795) and lost a considerable proportion of his BTC stack, over 200 BTC. It appears that hackers were able to compromise the Linux system being used, which granted access to lukedashjr's PGP encryption keys as well as his BTC. The PGP keys were used to sign Bitcoin Core and Knots releases, so these should be distrusted by users until the situation is resolved and lukedashjr presumably publishes a new PGP key.

Youtube personality Logan Paul's role in the CryptoZoo NFT project was [documented](https://www.vulture.com/2023/01/logan-paul-cryptozoo-scam-coffeezilla-allegations-explained.html) by Coffeezilla, with the conclusion that he was chief among scammers for a project which over-hyped a game that they were not realistically going to deliver. Paul threatened to sue CoffeeZilla but then [withdrew](https://cointelegraph.com/news/logan-paul-backflips-on-defamation-lawsuit-against-coffeezilla-apologizes) those threats and apologized. Logan Paul is now the [subject](https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/news-coffeezilla-reveals-class-action-lawsuit-filed-logan-paul-role-cryptozoo) of a class action lawsuit over his role in CryptoZoo.

Vitalik Buterin has [published](https://vitalik.ca/general/2023/01/20/stealth.html) a blog post about stealth addresses, describing privacy as one of the largest remaining challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem. Stealth addresses would be generated by the sender from a recipient's meta-address, which only the recipient could control but which would not be associated with their on chain identity. In other words it would give the same kind of privacy as generating a new address for each receipt of assets, but without the hassle of having to generate the new addresses.
