### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Hardening of consensus change voting code continued from [last month](202302.md#dcrd):

- Enhanced startup [validation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3068) of deployment parameters to ensure they satisfy the assumptions that the vote tallying logic rely on. For example, it checks that each vote has exactly one Abstain and one No choice, that there are no duplicate vote choices, or that choices are properly encoded in bits. This may unlock future optimizations and simplifications of code related to vote tallying.
- Added validation to ensure consensus change vote parameters [don't use special bits](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3073) reserved for approving or disapproving the previous block.
- Added validation to ensure that bits used by different votes in the same voting batch [do not overlap](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3077).
- Added validation rejecting vote choices with [empty IDs](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3079) (IDs are short strings summarizing what the vote choice means, they are normally `"yes"`, `"no"` or `"abstain"`).
- Reworked code determining consensus [vote stage and vote tallying](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3069) logic to optimize it and make it easier to reason about.
- Changed internal representation of the winning consensus vote choice for improved readability and additional protections from [misusing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3080) this code.
- Reworked tests for [consensus vote processing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3075) code to make them easier to understand, test more edge cases, and do so [more reliably](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3076).
- Note that the above changes are not breaking the consensus between versions in any way, they add more checks that allow dcrd to fail earlier if it detects that any assumptions made by the consensus code are violated.

Other changes:

- Re-request blocks and transactions [sooner](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3067) if the peer which was queried for them disconnects. Instead of waiting for this data to be announced again later, it will be requested immediately from peers that are known to have it.
- Fixed caching of other peers' [known inventory](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3074). It was a very minor bug with the potential to cause slightly higher traffic than is strictly necessary.
- Refactoring { 3071 3072 - drop after review } and [build config](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3081) updates.


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

- Removed needless [balance calculation](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2203) when using the ticket auto buyer and balance to maintain is unset or zero. On busier wallets this results in a significant performance improvement.
- Migrated to [VSP client](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2213) provided by the [vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) repository. It is mostly the same code borrowed from dcrwallet, but consolidating VSP code in one place allows to remove duplication that may fall out of sync, such as error codes, data structures, etc.
- Maintenance { 2214 (Go 1.20); 2215+2216 (unexport SaveRescanned method) }
- Fixed [data race](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2210) in SPV mode. { _may group in concurrency bugs_ }
- Fixed possibility of [missing relevant transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2212) in case the ticket purchase request is cancelled due to a change of the ticket price.
- Fixed logging { 2211 }


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

In progress:

- Updated to [DCRDEX v0.6.0 release](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3857). { _release imminent, worth mentioning despite being in april? - maybe, let's revise in future passes_ }
- Decrediton [Ledger integration](https://github.com/JoeGruffins/ledger-decred-poc) effort has been kickstarted by @JoeGruff with an initial [proof of concept](https://github.com/JoeGruffins/ledger-decred-poc) and a follow-up [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/609db9e) to make it production ready. Currently users are required to use Ledger Live software to send/receive DCR from/to their Ledger device, but historically there have been too many [technical problems](https://matrix.to/#/!MYLcxlwzxwViTaFPGo:decred.org/$fxDMmKpCE-Edb1fRQyhyy_Rjlx2HuKNGtpwSmC76nIA?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=planetdecred.org) with that software. Having Ledger support directly in Decrediton will give DCR holders a better choice.

Other:

- Decred staking with Trezor is [broken](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/pull/2703) on some versions of the firmware. A fix has been [submitted](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/pull/2703) to the Trezor firmware repository in December but has not been merged yet.


### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software for running a Voting Service Provider. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

Changes to make vspd code easier to consume by other software (such as dcrwallet):

- Removed ability to [override server signature validation](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/372) with a custom function. This feature was added to facilitate testing but turned out to be unnecessary and make the VSP client library harder to consume.
- Removed the need to [convert errors](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/374) in the calling code. This required to bump the major version of the module to v2.

Other changes:

- Added [rate limiting](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/373) of admin login requests (max 3 attempts per second), and a sample Nginx config to support it.
- Added new [development tool](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/366) for testing various steps of the VSP protocol: create VSP fee transaction, send it to the VSP, query ticket status, and change ticket's vote choices. VSP operators can use this tool to verify that their VSP works correctly.
- Increased test coverage.


### dcrpool

_[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool) is server software for running a mining pool._

- Updated to [Go 1.18](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/338).


### Lightning Network

_[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant and low-cost transactions._

- Upgraded to build and test against [Go 1.20](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/176).
- Updated [dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/177).

[LN Liquidity Provider](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnlpd) (LP):

- Added client-side [sanity checks](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnlpd/pull/9) to fail earlier when it is not possible to get an inbound channel from the LP. The client will use server's policy to determine if the server can create a channel of the desired size, and if the client will be able to pay for it. This allows to avoid fetching an invoice that will not be paid.
- Allow to [configure](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnlpd/pull/9) LP server's invoice expiration policy. A client can request the LP server to open Lightning Network channels for it. To pay for this service client must pay an invoice generated by the server. Server operator can now configure how long an invoice is valid for, and also how long a client must wait before requesting a new invoice.
- Updated [dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnlpd/pull/10).
- { _optionally add a short reminder of what LN LP is needed for / used by, for example: "LP is software that takes control of a normal LN node and adds one useful feature to it. Client software can request the LP to open a channel back to the client. This gives the client additional inbound capacity and allows to receive more funds over LN. The LP operator collects a small fee for the service. This feature is heavily used by Bison Relay." - is it a correct description? And does LP exist to enable light clients that don't want to run a full LN node? And can LP be used to create arbitrary channels in the network or just to self?_ }

Since Bison Relay is now a major user of Decred's Lightning Network, it benefits from improvements in the base LN software and the LN liquidity provider.


### cspp

_[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp) is a server for coordinating coin mixes using the CoinShuffle++ protocol. It is non-custodial, i.e. does not hold any funds._

- Updated [Go dependencies](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/89).


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

Internal pre-release testing of the major v0.6 release has started with a beta and two release candidates [tagged](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/tags) in March. All changes reported below will be included in the v0.6 release.

Client changes:

- Removed [default Bitcoin node](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2193) for getting compact block filters in SPV mode. It was added when there were few public Bitcoin full nodes supporting [BIP-157](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/86231/whats-the-distinction-between-bip-157-and-bip-158-are-they-supported-by-bitcoi/86232#86232). Now there are plenty and removing the default one may improve connectivity because it is often overloaded.
- Improved error message when database [failed to initialize](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2205), most commonly when attempting to start a second instance of dexc.

Client fixes:

- Fixed displayed status of [canceled orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2180). { _may group_ }
- Fixed empty [gaps between candles](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2195) on the price chart.
- Fixed inconsistent decimal [precision](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2208) on different UI elements.
- Fixed [price](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2214) not being updated in some places.
- Fixed repeated [icon fetching](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2217) on the Markets page.
- Fixed reorg indication for [DCR](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2219) and [BTC](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2225) in SPV mode to match dcrd and dcrwallet. Specifically, blocks that are not on the main chain ("orphaned" blocks) will be reported as having "-1" confirmations.
- Fixed [wallet birthday](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2236) showing UTC date instead of system's local date.
- Fixed [cancel orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2262) showing up in the order book. { _may group_ }
- Fixed a chance to get [negative amount](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2253) on Send form when the tx fee is comparable to amount left in the wallet. { _may group_ }
- Fixed switching of [asset icons](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2265). { _group_ }
- Fixed concurrency bugs { 2189 }
- Fixed logging { 2194 2272 }

Ethereum, client:

- Improved handling of poor connections to RPC providers when [shutting down](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2191) DEX client.
- Added [Ethereum wallet guide](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2233) wiki page.
- Added a 20% buffer to the [fee estimate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2234) when sending ETH to ensure it will succeed even if network's base fee jumps right before sending.
- Improved error message when [failing to connect](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2244) to RPC providers. { _group_ }
- Updated to [Geth v1.11](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2238). This was a required update for the Shanghai network upgrade scheduled on April 12, 2023.
- Fixed token's [parent asset balance](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2201) not being updated when cancelling an order involving that token.
- Fixed [unconfirmed transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2211) not being reflected in the available balance. { _second fix in 2247_ }
- Fixed display of [provider domain](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2273) when there is an error. { _group_ }

Ethereum, server:

- Allow server operators to rank RPC endpoints by [priority](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2199) in the config file. The healthy connection with the highest priority will always be attempted first.

Fidelity bonds:

- [UI updates](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2200) to replace registration fees with bonds, including integration of bonds into account import and export flows. Different cases are considered when restoring from same or new app seed, and when using existing or creating new DEX account.
- Implemented bonds funded [with BTC](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2196) in both the client and the server. It will be possible to switch bonds to use a different asset, e.g. from DCR to BTC.
- Fixed [logging](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2220) of registration fees config where bonds config was expected. { _group_ }
- Fixed "bond required" alert [not disappearing](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2221) after bond was confirmed.
- Fixed missed population of the ["Other"](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2274) balance category for BTC ("Other" includes balances related to bonds). { _group_ }

Other changes:

- Added [Windows tray](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/3a216ce3f750fa5e2f270a26d998d674024eb1f1) build to build script. { _may group_ }
- Added more strict server-side [checks](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2248) for addresses used in swaps.
- Updated [LTC dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2268) to pull in a [critical fix](https://github.com/ltcsuite/ltcd/pull/25) for handling large transactions.
- Test infra improvements. { 2204 }
- Dependency updates. { 2232 }

Client changes on `master` towards the next release (likely v0.6.1):

- Notify the user about [unstable connection](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2028). { _follow-up fix in 2235_ }
- Log HTTP requests to app's [standard logger](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2206). This disables log coloring but fixes time zone discrepancy on some systems. { _may group_ }
- Fixed error when [failing to subscribe](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2252) to new header notifications from Ethereum RPC provider.

Other stuff:

- DCRDEX was [rejected](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-apps/pull/430#issuecomment-1452436145) in the official Umbrel App Store becase "for crypto-related apps, we're exclusively accepting apps that solely focus on bitcoin". Two weeks later they [tweeted](https://twitter.com/umbrel/status/1636068336101621760) that censoring developers is anti-free market, which surprised some community members in context of the rejection. DCRDEX can still be used in Umbrel via the Community App Store feature by adding DEX repository and installing from there (follow [these instructions](https://github.com/decred/umbrel-app-store)). The difference is it requires more manual steps and exposes DCRDEX to fewer users compared to the central official Umbrel App Store.
- First mainnet swaps with DigiByte (DGB) have been [spotted](https://twitter.com/DigiByteCoin/status/1640820963532214273) on Twitter.

_Image: UI updates in DCRDEX to replace registration fees with time-locked bonds. UI design is a work in progress._


### dcrdata

_[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata) is an explorer for Decred blockchain and off-chain data like Politeia proposals, markets, and more._

- Added an [allowed hosts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1958) middleware to ensure that any `Host` header value set in the request header is on a whitelist of hosts. This prevents invalid or unexpected `Host` values even if dcrdata is deployed without Nginx, which normally takes care of it.
- Updated Decred and third party [Node.js modules](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1952) and Go [dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1959) to their latest versions, and moved builds to Go 1.19 and 1.20.


### Timestamply

_[Timestamply](https://github.com/decred/dcrtimegui) is a free service for timestamping files powered by Decred blockchain. A timestamp proves that a certain file has existed at a certain moment of time. This has a range of applications in protecting data integrity._

- { check if anything new in: https://proposals.decred.org/record/855a506/comments/18 }


### Documentation

_[dcrdocs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs) is the source code for Decred [user documentation](https://docs.decred.org/)._

- Added [syntax highlighting](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1219) to fix issues with hard to read code syntax, particularly in dark mode.
- Updated [PoS reward](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1220) numbers (30% to 80%) in the proof-of-stake [Overview page](https://docs.decred.org/proof-of-stake/overview/).
- Added a [glossary entry](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1217) for "Redeem Script".
- Updated [VSP staking information](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1217) on multiple pages. This includes removing most references to Redeem Scripts, removing "legacy" staking instructions, and simplifying the remaining staking instructions. 
- Consolidated the [pros and cons](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1217) of using VSP and solo staking.
- Added a [note](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1217) to the Redeem Script page indicating they are no longer relevant.
- The [Buying Tickets With dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1217) page has been optimized. It now clearly separates Voting and Purchasing tickets into two separate steps and removes any references to the outdated dcrstakepool system.
- Optimized [Docker build](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1222}): switched to much smaller image based on Alpine Linux, fixed MIME type for RSS feeds, and updated scripts to fail on error.


### Dev Docs

_[dcrdevdocs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdevdocs) is the source code for Decred [developer documentation](https://devdocs.decred.org/)._

- Upgraded to [MkDocs Material 9](https://github.com/decred/dcrdevdocs/pull/108) with improved search. Also upgraded to Python 3.11, Nginx 1.22, and optimized the Docker build.


### decred.org

_[dcrweb](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb) is the source code for the [decred.org](https://decred.org/) website._

Changes to the [News page](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1106):

- A more readable news outlet name is now displayed instead of website's domain name.
- Outlet and author are no longer displayed for software releases.

Docker:

- Updates and [cleanup](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1111).


### Bison Relay

_[Bison Relay](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay) is a new social media platform with strong protections against censorship, surveillance, and advertising, powered by Decred Lightning Network._

End user binaries have been released for Bison Relay v0.1.5 with all changes and fixes we reported in the [February issue](202302.md#bison-relay). Just one week later v0.1.6 Release Candidate 1 became available for download. Below are all changes in v0.1.6 RC1 and v0.1.6 final. The latter added very minor fixes and no binaries have been made for it.

Common changes in GUI and CLI apps in v0.1.6:

- Improved error handling and logging of [failed payments](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/156) (such as tipping).
- Implemented [new version of group chats](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/155) that introduces support for multiple admins. Admins can invite or remove members, and assign or revoke admin privileges. The permission to kill the group chat is still only possible by the special Owner role. Existing group chats will have an option to upgrade to new version.
- Improved help text for [adding LN receive capacity](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/166).
- Disallow comments on [relayed posts](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/162). Commenting on posts will require a key exchange with the original author. Also, once the original post is received from the author, all relayed copies will be removed in favor of the original.
- Fixed bug preventing to accept [multiple group chat invites](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/154) at the same time.
- Dependency updates. { 165 171 175 180 }
- Internal refactoring. { 188 }

GUI app changes in v0.1.6:

- Added sidebar notification icon for [new chat messages](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/157).
- Show [unread count](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/157) as "1k+" when it is over 1,000.
- Avoid redundant [last read indicator](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/157) when there are no previous messages in the chat.
- Added a prominent [New Post](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/159) button that is easy to access from different views.
- Added [highlighting of messages](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/164) that include user's nick.
- Added [seed verification step](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/174) where user is required to answer questions about their seed.
- Allow to copy LN node [pubkey and channel points](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/167) to clipboard. { _may group_ }
- Added [About page](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/175) with app version and copyright info.
- UI alignment tweaks. { 157 }
- Fixed segfault error [on close](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/157).
- Fixed errors when [leaving or killing](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/170) group chats. { _group_ }
- Fixed attempt to generate an avatar based on nick name's first letter when [nick is empty](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/183). { _group_ }

CLI app changes in v0.1.6:

- Added [autocompletion](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/163) of user names and group chat names to various commands.
- Added [Alt+V](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/153) as a Paste hotkey.
- Added a command to decode and inspect [LN invoices](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/166), improved logging of LN events (such as channel opened or closed).
- Display invite to group chat in a [private chat](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/169) with the inviting user.
- Added an option to include a [group chat invite](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/178) in an invite file. Invite recipient will be invited to group chat automatically after completing the initial key exchange with invite author.
- Fixed [wrapping](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/153) of multi-line text.

`clientrpc` [automation API](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/tree/master/clientrpc) changes in v0.1.6:

- Improved [cancellation and shutdown](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/issues/158) handling of the read loop.
- Added methods for [managing group chats](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/161) and [sending files](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/179).
- Fixed [reading](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/161) from the message replay log file.

Other changes in v0.1.6:

- Test improvements { 189 }

Other stuff:

- Image attachments are now delivered between Bison Relay and Matrix in both directions.
- Prepaid invites have been [announced](https://twitter.com/behindtext/status/1641080004778897408), they will help to onboard new users without requiring them to obtain DCR externally and fund their Bison Relay wallet.

## Governance

In March the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 8,388 DCR worth $174K at March's average rate of $20.69. 4,271 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $88K at March's rate.

A [treasury spend tx](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/tx/57c226c50632baf64aa3bb366e11c586c38689248a067b4642173a6a96fd47d0) was mined on March 13, it had 27 outputs making payments to contractors, ranging from 2.7 DCR to 1,264 DCR. At January's billing rate of $22.05 the TSpend is equivalent to $94K.

As of Apr 13, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 852,332 DCR (17.8 million USD at $20.90).

There were 7 proposals submitted in March:

- The Decred Journal and Politeia Digest [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/9e68dca) requested a budget of $40,000 and was approved with 86% Yes votes and turnout of 46%.

## Ecosystem

[Metal Pay](https://metalpay.com/) has disabled DCR trading according to a [user report](https://matrix.to/#/!teQafvHMYpIbqLIieU:decred.org/$JvKPmPcgLw-bUW-7Tn2QFlqmRFtLQN0pPC-4Qq5u0yY?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=t2bot.io). This is confirmed by their support site which no longer shows DCR in the list of [assets available for trading](https://help.metalpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409447985303-What-Cryptocurrencies-are-Available-for-Trading-on-Metal-Pay-). Assets supporting [deposits and withdrawals](https://help.metalpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409465061911-Which-Cryptocurrencies-Support-Deposit-and-Withdrawal-on-Metal-Pay-) do not include DCR either, and apparently never did. Other coins delisted in the same batch with DCR include BNB, BUSD, DGB, PAX and TUSD. In the bigger picture, Metal Pay [delisted](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zlmxj3/delisting_notice_for_select_tokens_on_metal_pay/) 13 assets in December including XMR, ZEC, DASH and BSV. Since [November 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20221207223930/https://help.metalpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409447985303-What-Cryptocurrencies-are-Available-for-Trading-on-Metal-Pay-) the list of tradeable assets reduced from 63 to just 15. Metal Pay first listed DCR in [April 2020](https://twitter.com/metalpaysme/status/1249745420206686208).

Bittrex's [Instant Buy](https://global.bittrex.com/instant) feature did not work for DCR due to low liquidity, according to a [user report](https://matrix.to/#/!teQafvHMYpIbqLIieU:decred.org/$GWyVIBD5k_vDEUPxJK3QTOFqdAot8he-q4RNcxLsmqo?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=t2bot.io). This did not affect limit orders.

[Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) representative came to Decred's Matrix chat room to share a [status update](https://matrix.to/#/!teQafvHMYpIbqLIieU:decred.org/$kwC-IMBBr92cstg707O_SlLBJEtCiOt_RmVTtE6S0dI?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=t2bot.io). The summary is: Decred support in Ledger Live is broken for some users, it is taking a long time to fix, and Ledger would love to redirect affected users to third party services compatible with their devices in the situation where an integration is broken on Ledger's side. It means Ledger is excited about the effort to add direct Ledger support to [Decrediton](https://proposals.decred.org/record/609db9e).

Binance [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/123tn1i/binance_close_isolated_margin_for_decred_and_some/) the delisting of DCR/BTC and DCR/USDT pairs from Isolated Margin. For context, NEBL and XVG are also part of this delisting batch. Regular (Spot) DCR trading is NOT affected by this. On a related note, personal quota in the Simple Earn product has [increased](https://matrix.to/#/!aNnAOHkWUdNcEXRGjJ:decred.org/$Iv4uASbdiLZIMZWbVVYFqY-motmynF19DH5MYvSRgNo?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=planetdecred.org) from 300 to 10,000 DCR per person. As of Mar 27, Simple Earn showed 1.67% APR (while staking DCR directly yields about 7%/year).

Bittrex made a big announcement about [shutting down U.S. operations](https://twitter.com/BittrexExchange/status/1641879884682387457) due to regulatory and economic environment. Per their [timeline](https://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/10080271948701), fiat withdrawals must conclude by Apr 24 and crypto withdrawals by Apr 29 (sooner is better). Bittrex Global and its non-U.S. customers are unaffected. The move came after Bittrex was [fined](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/crypto-exchange-bittrex-fined-53-mln-by-us-treasury-dept-2022-10-11/) in December for $29 million for violating sanctions and AML regulations. Soon after the announcement SEC hit Bittrex with a [lawsuit](https://reason.com/2023/04/19/sec-sues-crypto-exchange-bittrex-shortly-after-it-announces-its-leaving-u-s-markets/) for operating an unregistered securities exchange.

Three US banks failed in March, the largest of them being [Silicon Valley Bank](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/business/silicon-valley-bank-stock.html) (SVB), which was the second largest US bank failure of all time. One of the ripple effects was a temporary [de-pegging](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/11/usdc-stablecoin-depegs-from-1-circle-says-operations-are-normal/) of the USDC stablecoin as news emerged that ~10% of the funds backing USDC were stuck with SVB when the FDIC stepped in to take over  before Circle's withdrawal was processed. 

Binance has been [charged](https://decrypt.co/124800/binance-cftc-lawsuit-crypto) by the CFTC in a wide ranging complaint which covers a number of offences, including weak KYC/AML that allowed US customers to trade derivatives and securities which they were not registered to offer, allowed money laundering to occur, and traded against their own customers. The 74 page [complaint](https://www.docdroid.net/60YAbCz/cftc-binance-pdf) includes quotes from messages sent between internal staff, including such gems as "I HAZ NO CONFIDENCE IN OUR GEOFENCING", from the money laundering reporting officer. The complaint also mentions Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities, in service to defining Binance's activities as subject to CFTC's jurisdiction.

Justin Sun and his companies Tron Foundation, BitTorrent Foundation and Rainberry have been [sued](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-59) by the SEC for violations including sale of unregistered securities (TRX and BTT) and manipulating the secondary market for TRX through extensive wash trading. A number of celebrities who were engaged to promote Sun's projects have also been sued in the same motion for promoting TRX/BTT without disclosing the arrangement, they include Lindsey Lohan, Jake Paul, Soulja Boy, and Lil Yachty. The period for which Sun is accused of wash trading covers April 2018 to February 2019, during which time Sun allegedly provided between 4.5 million and 7.4 million TRX and instructed staff to wash trade it using two of his accounts.

Do Kwon, of Terra/Luna infamy, was [arrested](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/23/do-kwon-arrested-in-montenegro-interior-minister/) in Montenegro for using forged documents. Both the US and South Korea have[announced](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/03/29/the-questions-that-linger-after-do-kwons-arrest/) their wish to extradite and prosecute him.

The second Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) initiative by Optimism was [completed](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Upn_LtV2-3SviXgX_PE_LyA7YI00jQyoM1yf55ltvvI) in March, with 10 million OP being distributed to 195 different projects and people that had contributed something to the Optimism or Ethereum ecosystem. The funds were distributed to recipients in three different sections, Infrastructure (received 37%), Tooling & Utilities (32%) and Education (31%). To decide how the OP would be distributed, a panel of 90 community members was [formed](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/retropgf-2/#voting-badge-distribution) by selecting community members using a variety of different means. Each "badgeholder"  ranked the nominated projects and funds were dispersed according to a weighted average of their votes.

Arbitrum, an Ethereum Layer 2, conducted its long-anticipated airdrop, and there has been controversy about how well anticipated the conditions were by airdrop hunters. [Analysis](https://mirror.xyz/x-explore.eth/AFroG11e24I6S1oDvTitNdQSDh8lN5bz9VZAink8lZ4) of the airdrop indicated that, despite rules to avoid giving airdrops to Sybil users, as much as 48% of the airdropped tokens went to an address that was strongly associated with at least one other address which also received the airdrop - with 22% going to advanced Sybil users who had thousands of associated addresses receiving the airdrop.

Once the tokens were airdropped their holders (those who didn't dump immediately) became Arbitrum's governance decision-makers. The first proposal (AIP-1) they would decide on would allocate 750 Million ARB tokens to the Arbitrum Foundation, and it turned [messy](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/01/arbitrums-first-governance-proposal-turns-messy-with-1b-arb-tokens-at-stake/). Community members objected to the Foundation having discretion to spend some of these funds without on chain community approval, and when it was clear that the proposal was in difficulty the Foundation published a [blog post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/clarity-around-the-ratification-of-aip-1/12864) explaining that the vote was to ratify something that was already happening, the Foundation already had the funds and had in fact started spending them. This appears to have been a miscommunication about the nature of the vote, but following the controversy which erupted the Foundation has taken steps to reassure the community that the remaining 700 million ARB will not be touched until a proposal has been approved by the community.

This month's record breaking DeFi hack is a good news story, because it's the largest ever [recovery](https://twitter.com/eulerfinance/status/1643345907344379904) of funds, by the Euler Labs team. The Euler Finance protocol was [exploited](https://cointelegraph.com/news/euler-labs-hacker-returns-all-of-the-recoverable-funds-timeline) by a flash loan attack on March 13, the attacker was able to obtain $197 Million, and causing the value locked in Euler contracts to drop as low as $10 million. Euler Labs tried to negotiate the return of 90% of the funds with the hacker and when the negotiations broke down put out a $1 Million bounty for information about the attacker. Although a deal could not be reached the attacker began to sporadically return the funds, until eventually on April 4 Euler Labs announced that all the "recoverable funds" had been returned and the bounty was cancelled.

LinksDAO is seemingly on course to [achieve](https://twitter.com/LinksDAO/status/1636433901232222208) its main objective and buy a Links Golf Club, specifically Spey Bay on the Moray Coast of Scotland. The Club was listed for $905,000 and LinksDAO's representatives were the top bidders, with the sale to be confirmed and the final sale price as yet unknown. LinksDAO is still [reported](https://www.golfdigest.com/story/links-golf-club-buys-spey-bay-golf-links) to be on the lookout for US golf properties, as presumably not many of its 5,400 global members have easy access to the Moray Coast to play a round. 

The "Skull of Satoshi", an art installation commissioned by Greenpeace as part of a campaign to highlight the impact of PoW mining, has been [adopted](https://decrypt.co/124622/skull-satoshi-artist-says-was-wrong-bitcoin-mining) by the Bitcoin community as its own. The artist has come to the realisation that it is not a black and white issue, as they thought it was when they began creating the piece.

Ron DeSantis, Governor of Florida, has [proposed](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/20/florida-governor-ron-desantis-proposes-law-to-ban-cbdcs/) legislation to ban the acceptance of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in the state. [Doubts](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/03/22/cbdc-desantis-ban-digitaldollar/) have been raised whether the legislation is workable, it is likely that a Federal push for a CBDC could overturn pre-existing state law.

Nigeria has been pushing its CBDC, when [incentives](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/03/06/nigerians-rejection-of-their-cbdc-is-a-cautionary-tale-for-other-countries/) like discounts on taxi fares didn't work to increase adoption they restricted access to cash to force the issue, but not people are protesting about the lack of cash and still adoption of the CBDC is at less than 0.5% of the population.
