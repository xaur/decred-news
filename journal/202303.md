## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover its most notable dev work._
- _For each project, the order of reporting is "most released first": changes released to end users, merged to master, in progress (work started), discussions and future plans._
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commits/master }

Hardening of consensus change voting code continued from [last month](202302.md#dcrd):

- Enhanced startup [validation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3068) of deployment parameters to ensure they satisfy the assumptions that the vote tallying logic rely on. For example, it checks that each vote has exactly one Abstain and one No choice, that there are no duplicate vote choices, or that choices are properly encoded in bits. This may unlock future optimizations and simplifications of code related to vote tallying. { _curious how extra validation allows to optimize and simplify vote tallying_ }
- Added validation to ensure consensus change vote parameters [don't use special bits](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3073) reserved for approving or disapproving the previous block.
- Added validation to ensure that bits used by different votes in the same voting batch [do not overlap](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3077).
- Added validation rejecting vote choices with [empty IDs](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3079) (IDs are short strings summarizing what the vote choice means, they are normally `"yes"`, `"no"` or `"abstain"`).
- Reworked code determining consensus [vote stage and vote tallying](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3069) logic to optimize it and make it easier to reason about.
- Changed how winning consensus vote choice is represented for improved readability and additional protections from [misusing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3080) this code.
- Reworked tests for [consensus vote processing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3075) code to make them easier to understand, test more edge cases, and do so [more reliably](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3076).

Other changes:

- Re-request blocks and transactions [sooner](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3067) if the peer which was queried for them disconnects. Instead of waiting for this data to be announced again later, it will be requested immediately from peers that are known to have it.
- Fixed caching of other peers' [known inventory](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3074). { _was it a bug? what did it cause? did it affect any release?_ }
- Refactoring { 3071 3072 } and [build config](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3081) updates.


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

- Removed needless [balance calculation](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2203) when using the ticket auto buyer and balance to maintain is unset or zero.
- Migrated to [VSP client](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2213) provided by the [vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) repository, which is mostly based on dcrwallet's code. Consolidating VSP code in one place allows to remove duplication that may fall out of sync, such as error codes, data structures, etc.
- Maintenance { 2214 - Go 1.20, 2215+2216 - unexport SaveRescanned method }
- Fixed [data race](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2210) in SPV mode. { _may group in concurrency bugs_ }
- Fixed possibility of [missing relevant transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2212) in case the ticket purchase request is cancelled due to a change of the ticket price.
- Fixed logging { 2211 }


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

Internal pre-release testing of the major v0.6 release has started with a beta and two release candidates [tagged](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/tags) in March. All changes reported below will be included in the v0.6 release.

Client changes:

- Removed [default Bitcoin node](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2193) for getting compact block filters in SPV mode. It was added when there were few public Bitcoin full nodes supporting BIP-157. Now there are plenty and removing the default one may improve connectivity because it is often overloaded.
- Improved error message when database [failed to initialize](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2205), most commonly when attempting to start a second instance of dexc.

Client fixes:

- Fixed displayed status of [canceled orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2180) { _may group_ }
- Fixed empty [gaps between candles](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2195) on the price chart.
- Fixed inconsistent decimal [precision](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2208) on different UI elements.
- Fixed [price](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2214) not being updated in some places.
- Fixed repeated [icon fetching](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2217) on the Markets page.
- Fixed reorg indication for [DCR](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2219) and [BTC](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2225) in SPV mode to match dcrd and dcrwallet. Specifically, blocks that are not on the main chain ("orphaned" blocks) will be reported as having "-1" confirmations.
- Fixed [wallet birthday](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2236) showing UTC date instead of local date.
- Fixed [cancel orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2262) showing up in the order book. { _may group_ }
- Fixed a chance to get [negative amount](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2253) on Send form when the tx fee is comparable to amount left in the wallet. { _may group_ }
- Fixed switching of [asset icons](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2265). { _group_ }
- Fixed concurrency bugs { 2189 }
- Fixed logging { 2194 2272 }

Ethereum, client:

- Improved handling of poor connections to RPC providers when [shutting down](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2191) DEX client.

- Added a 20% buffer to the [fee estimate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2234) when sending ETH to ensure it will succeed even if network's base fee jumps right before sending.
- Improved error message when [failing to connect](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2244) to RPC providers. { _group_ }
- Updated to [Geth v1.11](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2238). This was a required update for the Shanghai network upgrade scheduled on April 12, 2023.
- Fixed token's [parent asset balance](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2201) not being updated when cancelling an order involving that token.
- Fixed [unconfirmed transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2211) not being considered in the reported available balance. { _second fix in 2247_ }
- Fixed display of [provider domain](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2273) when there is an error. { _group_ }

Ethereum, server:

- Allow server operators to rank RPC endpoints by [priority](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2199). The healthy connection with the highest priority will always be attempted first.

Fidelity bonds:

- [UI updates](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2200) to replace registration fees with bonds, including integration of bonds into account import and export flows. Different cases are considered when restoring from same or new app seed, and when using existing or creating new DEX account.
- Implemented bonds funded [with BTC](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2196) in both the client and the server. It will be possible to switch bonds to use a different asset, e.g. from DCR to BTC.
- Fixed [logging](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2220) of registration fees config where bonds config was expected. { _group_ }
- Fixed "bond required" alert [not disappearing](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2221) after bond was confirmed.
- Fixed missed population of the ["Other"](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2274) balance category for BTC ("Other" includes balances related to bonds). { _group_ }

Other changes:

- Added [Windows tray](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/3a216ce3f750fa5e2f270a26d998d674024eb1f1) build to build script. { _may group_ }

- Test infra improvements { 2204 }
- Dependency updates { 2232 }

Client changes on `master` towards the next release (likely v0.6.1):

- Notify the user about [unstable connection](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2028). { _follow-up fix in 2235_ }
- Log HTTP requests to app's [standard logger](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2206). This disables log coloring but fixes timezone discrepancy on some systems. { _may group_ }
- Fixed error when [failing to subscribe](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2252) to new header notifications from Ethereum RPC provider.

## Network

{ _Hint: "Network" tracks key "health" metrics of the fundamental infrastructure._ }

{ _Hint: n, n.n, and n.nn tell how many decimals to keep, e.g. 100, 16.5, 8.63_ }

**Hashrate**: March's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of {} Ph/s hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

{ _Hint: Fallback links for pool distribution: https://poolbay.io/crypto/54/decred , https://dcrstats.com/pow ._ }

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between {n}-{n} DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}).
