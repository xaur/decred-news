### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Developer and internal changes:

- [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3209) that was introduced in [October](./202310.md) with the new ability to handle [concurrent messages](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3203) from peers. Dcrd would hang if a peer disconnected after having sent multiple messages. This bugfix allows dcrd to respond gracefully when peers disconnect.
- Updated the [Docker image](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3210) to build with Go 1.21.4.
- Peers should not be sending each other nil messages. In an effort to preemptively find and debug cases where this might happen, dcrd will now [panic if a nil message is queued](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3213). This change includes a handy error trace to help inform devs about which bit of code caused the panic.


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

{ _Sources:_

- https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commits/master
- release branch

}

- Speed up [initial chain sync](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2295) time and reduce memory use.
- Added [unit tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2293) for the semantic versioning of the chain package.
- If any blocks in the chain violate the consensus for PoW or PoS difficulty, [report which block was invalid](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2294).
- If someone tries to spend a multisignature utxo, but the transaction contains any [invalid signatures](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2274), set `complete=false` to indicate that the transaction is not ready to send.
- Nov 10

### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

General client changes:

- Disable the [Place order](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2534) button on various conditions such as insufficient balance.
- Moved [Sign Out](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2590) button to the end of the hamburger menu.
- Tuned [colors](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2601): added some variation in element background colors in both light and dark modes, added slight background transparency to show a bit of what's behind a modal, tuned down background color in light mode to use a softer white color.
- Removed the [font weight change effect](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2610) on mouse hover because it didn't look consistent on various browsers and font settings.
- Changed the login flow to [not force server registration](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2614) after the local login, the user will be redirected to the Wallets page instead.
- Fixed [staking panel](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2586) not updating after wallet creation.
- Fixed prompt to create [missing wallets](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2577) on the Markets view.
- { _omitting: 2593 (log fix), 2595 (fix for 2534), 2612 (deps)_ }

Account trading tier, bonds, and reputation:

- Exposed more [bond and reputation data](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2575) in the registration and settings views. When user enters a tier number, a new preview form will show the the amount that will actually be locked for bonds, trading limits, and their USD equivalents. Trading form on the Markets view will show how many lots can be used for the current trading tier. Multiple help strings have been added to explain bonds, trading tier, and penalties for bad behavior.

Market maker bots:

- Updated [Market Maker Settings](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2587) UI to have a more responsive layout and explain bot strategies (there are 5 strategies currently).
- Added a strategy combining [market maker and simple arbitrage](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2530).

Desktop app:

- Fixed opening of [external](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2541) [links](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2597), they will trigger operating system's default URL handler (which may launch a default browser or show a dialog).
- Fix [dark mode](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2604) preference not saving on Linux. The fix is to save it in local storage instead of a cookie, because cookies are not persisted between app launches in the Linux version of the WebView component.

Decred:

- Added general infrastructure for [mixing funds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2478) and implemented the low-level bits for DCR (no GUI yet).

Bitcoin:

- Store [transaction history](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2550) for BTC SPV wallets. The underlying SPV wallet implementation (Neutrino) stores it already, but processing it leads to unreliable and confusing code. Storing transactions in a separate database fixes this and also unlocks more accuracy, such as differentiating regular send and swap transactions.

Zcash:

- Extracted Zcash code into its own [wallet implementation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2553). This is needed to untangle it from Bitcoin code, because the Zcash wallet is very different from Bitcoin. The change allows to make Zcash wallets shielded by default and resolve some internal issues.

Ethereum:

- Show [token contract address](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2592) on the UI so the users could be sure which Ethereum or Polygon token they are using. For example, the ERC-20 contract address for USDC is [0xa0b8699...eb48](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48).

Internal and developer changes:

- Updated client's [web dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2584), it fixes one critical vulnerability in the Babel compiler.
- { _omitting: 2570 (test imports)_ }

In progress:

- A proof of concept toy mesh network implementation called [Tatanka](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2602) has been submitted for discussion. This is work towards the [DCRDEX mesh proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/4d2324b) approved in June 2023. Readers are advised to watch a [short video](https://youtu.be/uZRTLpXXlds) to understand what Tatanka is (try [Invidious](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=uZRTLpXXlds) if the video is restricted for your location).
- An implementation of [private atomic swaps](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/pull/130) with Schnorr adaptor signatures has been submitted for review to the atomicswap repository. Atomic swap method currently used by DCRDEX leaves the same value on both chains, allowing anyone to link buyer's and seller's transactions. Adaptor signatures allow to fix this privacy vulnerability at the cost of some additional off-chain communication required between the parties. Note that `atomicswap` is a command-line tool separate from the DCRDEX project, but the code pioneered in it could be applied to DCRDEX as well.

### Bison Relay

_[Bison Relay](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay) is a new social media platform with strong protections against censorship, surveillance, and advertising, powered by Decred Lightning Network._

Work listed below has been merged to `master` towards future releases.

Changes in both GUI and text apps:

- Filter [unwanted content](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/377) when reading saved chat history. Previously content filtering handled newly received messages only.
- Replaced Bittrex with MEXC as a source of [exchange rates](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/383).

User-facing GUI app changes:

- Allow to [select text](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/379) in news feed and posts.
- Fixed newly created group chat [not appearing](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/376) in Chat Rooms.

GUI app changes for mobile builds:

- Various [mobile fixes and UX refinements](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/375), including: replace menu button with Back button in some pages, font size tweaks, onboarding tweaks, overflow fixes, and Android build fixes.
- Increased [spacing](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/378) in chats based on user feedback.

Internal GUI app changes:

- Consolidated font size declarations and usages for consistency and greater control of fonts based on which OS or platform the app is running.
- { _omitting: 335 (relnotes)_ }

In progress:

- Users reported various [LN channel issues](https://matrix.to/#/!GHnoHXSgkVAsUknRUg:decred.org/$nOaRAKaygrxyyvZkPzJ4jGr5S0MsC7FGYS0iPFRG7pc) when interacting with the Oprah bot. The root cause of some of them was found in dcrlnd and is being worked on.


### Cake Wallet Integration

Completed work merged in the intermediate [integration tree](https://github.com/JoeGruffins/cake_wallet/tree/cw-decred):

- Added a [stub for libwallet](https://github.com/JoeGruffins/cake_wallet/pull/4) to move forward with higher-level code while the real libwallet is being written. Also removed a lot of unnecessary code left from earlier experiments.
- Continued investigation of best ways to call Decred's code written in Go from Cake's high-level code written in Flutter.
- Three developers configured build environments and got working builds of Cake Wallet showing dummy Decred views on iOS, Android, and macOS. This milestone is notable considering how complex and confusing the build process is.
- { _omitting:_ https://github.com/JoeGruffins/cake_wallet/pull/6 }

In progress work for Cake Wallet:

- First change adding [initial Decred screens](https://github.com/cake-tech/cake_wallet/pull/1165) has been submitted to the upstream repository's integration branch.
- Integrating [libwallet](https://github.com/JoeGruffins/cake_wallet/pull/8) (built as a C library), including any necessary glue code in Kotlin and Swift, and build code for various OSes and CPU architectures.
- Scripts and how-to guide for building Cake Wallet [on macOS](https://github.com/cake-tech/cake_wallet/pull/1163). This documents the missing knowledge of the complex build process that was quite hard to discover.

Merged work for [libwallet](https://github.com/itswisdomagain/libwallet):

- Implemented [basic functions](https://github.com/itswisdomagain/libwallet/pull/1) for DCR, BTC and LTC wallets, including: create wallet, create watch-only wallet, open wallet, start/stop wallet sync, set wallet birthday. This borrows some code from DCRDEX and builds on top existing cryptocurrency projects written in Go, including: [Decred](https://github.com/decred), [btcsuite](https://github.com/btcsuite), [ltcsuite](https://github.com/ltcsuite), [Neutrino](https://github.com/lightninglabs/neutrino) for BTC and [Neutrino fork](https://github.com/dcrlabs/neutrino-ltc) for LTC (plus patches from DCRDEX developers).
- Storage implementation for saving [wallet config and transaction data](https://github.com/itswisdomagain/libwallet/pull/3).

In progress work for libwallet:

- A wrapper layer for building libwallet as a [C library](https://github.com/itswisdomagain/libwallet/pull/2) that could be called from Cake Wallet's high-level app code.
- A package for managing [wallet sync](https://github.com/itswisdomagain/libwallet/pull/4) and reporting sync progress for DCR, BTC and LTC wallets.

libwallet is a multi-coin library implementing light (SPV) wallets for Decred, Bitcoin and Litecoin. It was originally created to integrate Decred in Cake Wallet, but it has potential to become a platform for building Decred and multi-coin software. The second app to use libwallet will likely be the Cryptopower wallet. This will be similar to how the now-discontinued [dcrlibwallet](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrlibwallet) was shared by GoDCR and Android/iOS Decred apps, but will support more assets than just Decred. C interop layer will be added soon which will allow to use libwallet from any programming language that can call C code, facilitating Decred integrations in a wide array of existing and new crypto software (this was one of the goals of the [TinyDecred v2](202206.md#tinywallet) effort). Wallet apps built on libwallet will have much better privacy compared to many existing apps in the market, where it is common to use central servers that can track users' funds. Unfortunately, Cake's Bitcoin wallet is one of such cases because it relies on Electrum servers which is [not good for privacy](https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html). Under the hood libwallet uses [dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) for Decred and [Neutrino](https://github.com/lightninglabs/neutrino) for Bitcoin, which connect directly to full nodes and fetche data privately without revealing owned funds and transactions.

}

In November the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 7,060 DCR worth $101K at November's average rate of $14.35. 8,471 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $122K at same rate.

A [treasury spend tx](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/ca24ed5e5d4819ca68b270a78345be07d5a18890b83ada366e970807425e8bfc) was approved with 7,354 Yes votes and 57% turnout, and mined on Nov 21. It had 50 outputs making payments to contractors, ranging from 3 DCR to 1,411 DCR. Most of this DCR was likely paid for September and October work, at its billing exchange rate of ${} the TSpend is worth around ${}. 

One of the considerations around the timing and structuring of treasury payments to contractors for these months is to stay within the limit of 150% of monthly inflows as dictated by [DCP-0007](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0007/dcp-0007.mediawiki). The lower DCR/USD exchange rate and decline in block reward subsidy over time means that hitting the limit is a realistic concern for the first time, especially if there is a backlog of older invoices accumulates. In this case invoices that were already submitted for October were sent for payment at the same time as those for September rather than waiting another month which would have been usual.

Bitcoin mining pool f2pool has [admitted](https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-mining-pool-f2pool-acknowledges-ofac-transaction-censorship-backpedals-after-community-backlash/) to censoring transactions from OFAC-sanctioned addresses. This behaviour was discovered by Bitcoin developer 0xB10C by analysing transactions which should have been included by f2pool but weren't. Initially f2pool denied the behaviour but they subsequently admitted it and said they would pause it until community consensus could be established - but they have deleted the various posts about it since.

A fake "Ledger Live" app made it into the Microsoft app store and as a result whoever released it was sent 38 transactions worth $588K as it [stole](https://cointelegraph.com/news/fake-ledger-live-app-sneaks-into-microsoft-app-store-as-victims-lose-half-a-million) the BTC of people who thought they were using the proper Ledger Live software to access their hardware wallet.

LBRY Inc. is [winding](https://x.com/LBRYcom/status/1715108834950123929) down after the SEC sued it into bankruptcy, all of its assets will be sold off to pay creditors. Odysee will continue using the LBRY network to provide its video sharing service, by some [measures](https://odysee.com/@lbry:3f/theendoflbryinc:d) one of the most highly used web3 platforms with 5.3 million unique monthly users.

KyberSwap was subjected to a [hack](https://twitter.com/kybernetwork/status/1727475235342217682) and urged users to withdraw their funds if able, but the attacker was able to get hold of around $55 million of users' funds by [performing](https://therecord.media/kyberswap-crypto-platform-54-million-hack) a sophisticated sequence of actions that allowed them to exploit a vulnerability to manipulate prices. The KyberSwap team offered a 10% bounty for return of the funds and the attacker replied in an on chain message that negations would begin in a few hours when they were rested. Front running bots were able to join in the exploit and get $5.7M of user funds before the attacker, the operators of the bots are [returning](https://twitter.com/KyberNetwork/status/1728800315955437743) funds for a 10% bounty.

There have been four major hacks in two months [targeting](https://cointelegraph.com/news/justin-sun-platforms-hacked-4-times) exchanges and a bridge operated by Justin Sun. HTX exchange (formerly Huobi) suffered two hacks for $8M and $30M, while Poloniex was hit for $100M, reportedly due to a private key compromise. HTX's HECO Chain bridge, used to move funds between the exchange and various chains, was the other casualty, with $87M making its way to suspicious addresses.

The Aragon Association has [announced](https://protos.com/aragon-helped-lido-curve-form-daos-now-its-dissolving/) that it intends to disband, returning 95% of the assets held by the organisation to ANT token holders and retaining 5% to settle obligations. ANT holders will be able to redeem ANT for ETH at a rate of 0.0025376 ETH per ANT until Nov 2 2024, at which point any unclaimed funds will revert to the newly formed "Aragon Shield", where they will be put towards some loosely defined continuation of product development. Although Aragon's software tools were used by successful DAOs such as Lido and Curve, the team decided that it was not possible to derive any value for ANT holders from this kind of usage, and they have acknowledged that ventures like "Aragon Court" were not viable.

Some of the ANT token holders are not happy with the Aragon Association plan, specifically the retention of $11 million plus all unclaimed funds after a year for Aragon Shield, and they have [backed](https://twitter.com/dcfgod/status/1726861803257471313/) a proposal to go after Aragon Association for more money via a "highly conditional grant" to Patagon Management LLC, a trading company specialising in this kind of legal action to recover funds.

Attendees at the Bored Ape Yacht Club's annual ApeFest were [subjected](https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/11/bored-ape-creator-says-uv-lights-at-apefest-burned-attendees-eyes-and-skin/) to UV light exposure, with over 20 people who were located too near a UV light reporting severe pain and burning sensations in their eyes, likely caused by photokeratitis or sunburn of the cornea.

Monero chain sleuths Moonstone Research have [analysed](https://moonstoneresearch.com/2023/11/03/Postmortem-of-Monero-CCS-Hack.html) the transactions made by the attacker who drained the Community Crowdfunding System (CCS) wallet and come up with some transactions they are fairly sure represent the attacker sending funds to an exchange or counterparty. This caused some [controversy](https://x.com/sethforprivacy/status/1720792327579414915) in the community because Monero is known for its privacy, but this is a "worst case scenario" for privacy where the wallet's private keys and metadata have been shared with the investigators, and the attacker appears to have made an unusual transaction (using the Monerujo's "PocketChange" feature) and some other missteps (sweeping the wallet) which have made the job of the investigators easier.

There are various proposals for a new Monero CCS system design which avoids the pitfall of having a large sum of XMR under the control of some core member(s) who can be targeted. One of these is a "[cypherpunk proposal](https://monero.observer/cypherpunk-transmission-017-rethinking-monero-ccs-cypherpunk-proposal/)" which would remove the custodian role by having people donate directly to the wallets of the project owners once they are greenlit for funding - so removing the centralised oversight and release of funds.

Fluffypony has [proposed](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/921) disbanding the "Monero Core Team" in favour of 6 workgroups whose membership is determined by community consensus, with a cutover date of Jan 1 2024. The proposal is partly driven by recent issues with the CCS funds, but the Core team is also seen as having too much control in general, and some of the roles, like those dealing with service providers, require "individuals in those particular roles to not be abrasive, and to be warm and understanding and friendly with the individuals they deal with at those service providers". The workgroups he proposes relate to the General Donation Fund, the Community Crowdfunding System, Intellectual Property holding, Servers and CDN hosting, Git maintenance, and Community Channels moderation. The proposal calls for a straw poll consensus mechanism to be decided to select members of the workgroups, but stipulates that only participants with several years of contributions should be considered for membership of a workgroup.

Jae Kwon, the Cosmos founder, has [called](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/27/cosmos-founder-calls-for-chain-split-atom-down-3/) for a chain splitting hard fork after a proposal to decrease ATOM issuance was approved by the community against his wishes. The proposal to drop the issuance rate from 14% annually to 10% was passed with 41.1% yes votes and 31.9% no votes from the voting power that participated - the rationale for the change was that Cosmos Hub was paying too much for security. Kwon's chain split proposal would form a new chain that has its own token but would also allow the original ATOM token to be used in some way. This may also resolve some tension in the community around a vetoed plan for "Cosmos 2.0" which had significant levels of support but was deemed too risky by the leadership.  

The US Federal Reserve is [coming](https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1720433939431477400) after Bitcoin Magazine for making fun of their FedNow service in a way which they allege infringes on their copyright and trademarks. Bitcoin Magazine has [published](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/federal-reserve-threatens-to-sue-bitcoin-magazine) an open reply declining to comply by removing the offending t-shirt which contains the trademark from their store.
