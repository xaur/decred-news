    - _changes released to end users_
    - _merged to master_
    - _in progress (work started)_
    - _discussions and future plans_
  - _Step 3: Organize further:_
    - _user-facing up top_

_1. Besides dramatic "epic fails", try to also report "epic wins" in areas relevant to Decred. Balance is good and we can learn from both._

_2. Order the stories as follows:_

- _Crypto L1 tech: PoW, ASIC resistance, full nodes, network security, etc._
- _Crypto L2+ tech: "Smart" contracts, DEX projects_
- _Crypto governance, finances, transparency, funding, chain forks, community splits_
