## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover notable dev work as recommended below._
  - _Step 1: Add every PR/commit in chronological order (oldest first)_
    - _this is for easier intermediate review_
  - _Step 2: Order/group changes "most released first":_
    - _changes released to end users_
    - _merged to master_
    - _in progress (work started)_
    - _discussions and future plans_
  - _Step 3: Organize further:_
    - _user-facing up top_
    - _dev stuff down below_
  - _Step 4: After dev review, group further and tidy_
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

General client changes:

- Disable the [Place order](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2534) button on various conditions such as insufficient balance.
- Moved [Sign Out](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2590) button to the end of the hamburger menu.
- Tuned [colors](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2601): added some variation in element background colors in both light and dark modes, added slight background transparency to show a bit of what's behind a modal, tuned down background color in light mode to use a softer white color.
- Removed the [font weight change effect](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2610) on mouse hover because it didn't look consistent on various browsers and font settings.
- Changed the login flow to [not force server registration](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2614) after the local login, the user will be redirected to the Wallets page instead.
- Fixed [staking panel](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2586) not updating after wallet creation.
- Fixed prompt to create [missing wallets](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2577) on the Markets view.
- { _omitting: 2593 (log fix), 2595 (fix for 2534), 2612 (deps)_ }

Account trading tier, bonds, and reputation:

- Exposed more [bond and reputation data](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2575) in the registration and settings views. When user enters a tier number, a new preview form will show the the amount that will actually be locked for bonds, trading limits, and their USD equivalents. Trading form on the Markets view will show how many lots can be used for the current trading tier. Multiple help strings have been added to explain bonds, trading tier, and penalties for bad behavior.

Market maker bots:

- Updated [Market Maker Settings](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2587) UI to have a more responsive layout and explain bot strategies (there are 5 strategies currently).
- Added a strategy combining [market maker and simple arbitrage](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2530).

Desktop app:

- Fixed opening of [external](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2541) [links](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2597), they will trigger operating system's default URL handler (which may launch a default browser or show a dialog).
- Fix [dark mode](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2604) preference not saving on Linux. The fix is to save it in local storage instead of a cookie, because cookies are not persisted between app launches in the Linux version of the WebView component.

Decred:

- Added general infrastructure for [mixing funds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2478) and implemented the low-level bits for DCR (no GUI yet).

Bitcoin:

- Store [transaction history](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2550) for BTC SPV wallets. The underlying SPV wallet implementation (Neutrino) stores it already, but processing it leads to unreliable and confusing code. Storing transactions in a separate database fixes this and also unlocks more accuracy, such as differentiating regular send and swap transactions.

Zcash:

- Extracted Zcash code into its own [wallet implementation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2553). This is needed to untangle it from Bitcoin code, because the Zcash wallet is very different from Bitcoin. The change allows to make Zcash wallets shielded by default and resolve some internal issues.

Ethereum:

- Show [token contract address](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2592) on the UI so the users could be sure which Ethereum or Polygon token they are using. For example, the ERC-20 contract address for USDC is [0xa0b8699...eb48](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48).

Internal and developer changes:

- Updated client's [web dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2584), it fixes one critical vulnerability in the Babel compiler.
- { _omitting: 2570 (test imports)_ }

In progress:

- A proof of concept toy mesh network implementation called [Tatanka](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2602) has been submitted for discussion. This is work towards the [DCRDEX mesh proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/4d2324b) approved in June 2023. Readers are advised to watch a [short video](https://youtu.be/uZRTLpXXlds) to understand what Tatanka is (try [Invidious](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=uZRTLpXXlds) if the video is restricted for your location).
- An implementation of [private atomic swaps](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/pull/130) with Schnorr adaptor signatures has been submitted for review to the atomicswap repository. Atomic swap method currently used by DCRDEX leaves the same value on both chains, allowing anyone to link buyer's and seller's transactions. Adaptor signatures allow to fix this privacy vulnerability at the cost of some additional off-chain communication required between the parties. Note that `atomicswap` is a command-line tool separate from the DCRDEX project, but the code pioneered in it could be applied to DCRDEX as well.

The Aragon Association has [announced](https://protos.com/aragon-helped-lido-curve-form-daos-now-its-dissolving/) that it intends to disband, returning 95% of the assets held by the organisation to ANT token holders and retaining 5% to settle obligations. ANT holders will be able to redeem ANT for ETH at a rate of 0.0025376 ETH per ANT until Nov 2 2024, at which point any unclaimed funds will revert to the newly formed "Aragon Shield", where they will be put towards some loosely defined continuation of product development. Although Aragon's software tools were used by successful DAOs such as Lido and Curve, the team decided that it was not possible to derive any value for ANT holders from this kind of usage, and they have acknowledged that ventures like "Aragon Court" were not viable.

Some of the ANT token holders are not happy with the Aragon Association plan, specifically the retention of $11 million plus all unclaimed funds after a year for Aragon Shield, and they have [backed](https://twitter.com/dcfgod/status/1726861803257471313/) a proposal to go after Aragon Association for more money via a "highly conditional grant" to Patagon Management LLC, a trading company specialising in this kind of legal action to recover funds.

Attendees at the Bored Ape Yacht Club's annual ApeFest were [subjected](https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/11/bored-ape-creator-says-uv-lights-at-apefest-burned-attendees-eyes-and-skin/) to UV light exposure, with over 20 people who were located too near a UV light reporting severe pain and burning sensations in their eyes, likely caused by photokeratitis or sunburn of the cornea.




{ _Hints (all optional):_

_1. Besides dramatic "epic fails", try to also report "epic wins" in areas relevant to Decred. Balance is good and we can learn from both._

_2. Order the stories as follows:_

- _Crypto L1 tech: PoW, ASIC resistance, full nodes, network security, etc._
- _Crypto L2+ tech: "Smart" contracts, DEX projects_
- _Crypto governance, finances, transparency, funding, chain forks, community splits_
- _Relevant exchanges and websites_
- _Regulations, privacy, security_
- _Fun stuff_
