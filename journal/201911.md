Bug in Zcash implementation [leaked metadata](https://duke.leto.net/2019/10/01/zcash-metadata-leakage-cve-2019-16930.html) and allowed to link IP addresses to Zcash shielded addresses (_missed in Oct_). From the developer who discovered it: "All people who use zaddrs and who have shared zaddrs with 3rd parties. (...) Consider your IP address and geo-location information associated with it as tied to your zaddr.". The bug was copied from Bitcoin Core codebase and introduced in Zcash in 2016. The leak was fixed in v2.0.7-3, although the [security announcement](https://z.cash/support/security/announcements/security-announcement-2019-09-24/) just recommended to upgrade immediately without any details. A number of project inheriting Zcash code is affected as well. This shows that privacy tech is very delicate and requires less error-prone programming approach, extremely thorough review and testing.

https://www.unknown.fund/press-release great example that given a fair and open money system, sooner or later people begin to organize to fund great things.

ZEC trademark:

  - https://www.coindesk.com/zcash-trademark-talks-were-about-more-than-a-logo
  - "If we had a robust, both Sybil-resistant and anonymous voting system, then we wouldn’t even be having this conversation," Mann told CoinDesk.
  - In Decred, there is another dimension where legitimacy of the chain is established by voters. Minority forks are heavily disincentivized. Even if someone attempts to steal the Decred "trademark", there will never be confusion about what the original chain is because voters are signing each block. Also, Decred has a very clear answer to "who exactly is hiring the dev org? what is the 'community'?" - stakeholders.

Bittrex has [adopted](https://www.coindesk.com/bittrex-chainalysis-kyt) Chainalysis [Know Your Transaction](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/real-time-alerts-press-release) software that monitors 15 cryptoassets for suspicious activity in real-time. (_missed in Sep_).

{this seem to have been fixed} New and "improved" version of CoinDesk doesn't show any content unless you enable javascript and certain browser features. For readers that don't want to enable them, this means all past content (that was not archived) is no longer accessible. For those who will keep the features enabled this means more browser fingerprinting and attack vectors. For CoinDesk it allows to be less accountable because this way of client-side rendering actively resists the creation of page snapshots by web notaries like web.archive.org or archive.today.

{other: regulations, security, fun}

U.S. Federal Reserve is [hiring](https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-federal-reserve-hiring-new-manager-to-research-digital-currencies) a manager to research digital currencies for up to $250K a year.

U.S. Fed [announced](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_191114) that they will "offer three additional term repo operations with longer maturities that extend past the end of 2019". This measure is an addition to existing 1-day and 14-day repo operations and purchases of Treasury bills.

If you ever wondered who gets the repo money, you will have to [wait](http://gata.org/node/19583) two years.

The Fed itself [admitted](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/powells-fantasy-the-economy-should-grow-faster-than-debt/) that U.S. national debt growing faster than nominal GDP is "not sustainable", shortly after the debt exceeded $23 trillion. Interestingly, he said it's not the Fed's job to fix it. The debt has two sides. On the one side, someone is creating demand by taking more and more debt. On the other side, the Fed is making the debt drug much more accessible by cutting rates, lending money to banks and "purchasing" assets like stocks and bonds. Something nobody wants to talk about is where the this money comes from.

U.S. companies are [stacking up cash](https://www.axios.com/businesses-spending-indicators-recession-533481fc-dba7-4b5c-add4-c11628c335bc.html) to prepare for an economic downturn. A notable quote from the Axios story: "Data from the Investment Company Institute shows that even though the stock market has risen by nearly 25% this year, investors have been net sellers of stocks, pulling $100 billion out of equity funds.". A Zero Hedge [article](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/conundrum-2019-equity-outflows-are-biggest-ever-yet-stocks-are-all-time-highs-what-happens) shows a weird phenomena of money flowing out of equities yet the prices keeps setting new ATHs. How is that possible? Some factors making it possible are the companies themselves being the biggest buyers (stock buybacks), central banks creating money that flows into stocks, paired with a simultaneous decline of trading volume.

The "fun" part in these dynamics where investors are [moving to cash](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/world-s-rich-readying-for-major-stock-sell-off-ubs-wealth-says) is that while it saves their value from more risky assets and negative interest rates, it will still be diluted by endless printing of fiat money.

Global debt is hitting all-time highs. The numbers vary by the source: $188 trillion and 230% of the world output figure comes from [IMF chief](https://www.ibtimes.com/global-debt-surges-record-high-188-tn-imf-chief-2861715), while $250 trillion and 320% of world output figure is from [Axios](https://www.axios.com/capital-markets-eye-world-soaring-debt-400f9f37-46b5-45ad-9487-c09ba8958c09.html), which cited Institute of International Finance.

Certain physical security providers report an increased [demand](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-20/world-s-rich-are-rattled-and-looking-for-old-fashioned-security) for safe desit boxes to store precious metals, cash and cryptocurrency. The motives cited are fears of a global recession, avoidance of negative interest rates and natural disasters.

Several U.S. organizations acted in concert to "deflate the bitcoin bubble of 2017" according to a CoinDesk [story](https://www.coindesk.com/trump-administration-popped-2017-bitcoin-bubble-ex-cftc-chair-says). "One of the untold stories of the past few years is that the CFTC, the Treasury, the SEC and the \[National Economic Council\] director at the time, Gary Cohn, believed that the launch of bitcoin futures would have the impact of popping the bitcoin bubble. And it worked.". While the move is presented as helping the market by "popping the bubble", giving traders the ability to "express a pessimistic view" even if they _don't own_ the asset, and preventing "believer's market", it somewhat reminds of the smart use of futures [in 1974](http://www.gata.org/node/17081) to increase volatility of gold and discourage people from holding it. _(missed in October)_

Czech Central Bank forbids to use the word "coin" https://www.bitcoininsider.org/article/77479/czech-central-bank-prepares-fine-calling-physical-bitcoins-coins

During October [protests](https://twitter.com/dalalmawad/status/1186705664229466112) in Lebanon the banks were [closed](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/23/lebanon-protests-fears-of-a-cash-crisis-as-banks-remain-shut.html) for two weeks for safety reasons. Upon reopening on Nov 1 capital controls were [established](https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/11/07/how-unofficial-capital-controls-stopped-a-run-on-the-banks-in-lebanon/) limiting daily withdrawals and transfers abroad.

GitHub has [removed](https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/github-removes-tsunami-democratics-apk-after-a-takedown-order-from-spain/) the APK of an app for organizing protests in Catalonia, acting on a court takedown request sent by Spain's national police force with military status.

Trojan-enabled version of Tor browser was [targeting](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/18/fleecing-onion-trojanized-tor-browser/) Bitcoin users, discovered by ESET. The trojan version was spreading from `tor-browser[.]org` and `torproect[.]org` domains.

Zcash fake wallet https://twitter.com/mineZcash/status/1185908172105453568 (_missed in Oct_).

Another fake Decred wallet was noticed, reported and quickly removed by GitHub. The account named `decreds` and the way the fake [v1.5.0 release](https://archive.today/ivVRO) was published looked surprisingly similar to previous "v1.5.0 Mandatory Update" by `DecredCoin` covered in [September](201909.md). Looks like hackers can't wait for v1.5 final. We too! If you encounter anything like this on GitHub or elsewhere, please report it to the platform immediately, and let the community know too to minimize possible damage.

If you couldn't upload enough of your data to Google, it is [rumored](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/google-reportedly-offering-checking-accounts-next-year.html) to get into the banking business and offer checking accounts next year. Project codename "Cache" is a bit ironical because in computing caches are often wiped.
