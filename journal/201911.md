## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

Performance enhancements, backporting of changes to the v1.5 release, code cleanup.

While v1.5 is awaiting its final release, development is moving towards the [1.6.0](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/milestone/24) milestone.

[`regentemplate`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1979) command introduced to force the generation of latest template with any new transactions.

Mempool changed to [evict](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1982) any remaining orphan transactions when the peer they sent from disconnects and to [modify](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1984) orphan tx policy in accordance with recent improvements.

New chain parameter [added](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2000) for specifying minimum total known work of the chain. The code checking whether the chain is current is updated to use total work instead of height of the final checkpoint. This method does not rely on trusted known checkpoints, is valid regardless of the order that blocks are received and processed, and, in general, is a more objective value that can't be invalidated by a chain reorg.

`lru` package was [extended](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2002) to allow insertion and retrieval of key-value pairs (in addition to just values).

Block ancestor traversal significantly optimized by introducing a [deterministic skip list](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2010).

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

Bug fixes, new methods, code cleanup.

Method added to detect [reused addresses](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1616) and their corresponding outpoints.

Issues preventing VSP ticket buying [addressed](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1618). { what issues? did VSP ticket buying break? was it in master or in a v1.5 RC? }

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton):

Numerous bug fixes and UI tweaks, code cleanup.

Toggle added to [create](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2310) LN-specific wallet account when first initializing an LN wallet. This incentivizes users to not use their default wallet account which is likely to have the majority of their funds, which could cause many channels to be automatically opened if the autopilot feature was selected.

New batch of [responsive views](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2019-11-01..2019-11-30+responsive) implemented.

Multiple bugs found during the testing of RC1 and RC2 were fixed.

In total 54 pull requests were [merged](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2019-11-01..2019-11-30) in November.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia):

Payment information [added](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1051) to backend, allowing the CMS to fully recover invoice information anchored on politeiad. 

Building politeiavoter on [Windows](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1046) is now supported.

Implementation of [RFP process](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1054) has started.

[dcrstakepool](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool):

Work started to [enable](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/571) arbitrarily voting on tickets whose voting rights the server has the private key for. { what is this for? }

Work continues to implement [per-ticket](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/568) authentication and ticket purchasing to remove user accounts, voting address reuse and the email requirement.

[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool): work in progress to add extensive [test coverage](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/141).

[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd):

Bug fixes, improved tests and build infrastructure.

Dockerfile [updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/56) for dcrlnd.

[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp): increased RPC timeout, improved client-server error handling, allwed use of LetsEncrypt staging server.

[dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex):

Development is hot. New components implemented in November:

- [auth manager](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/50)
- [account registrar](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/58)
- initial version of [Decred wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/49) client

[dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid):

Work on new UI continues with overhauled [send](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/issues/510), [overview](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/issues/506), [restore wallet](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/issues/505) and [verify seed](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/pull/530) pages.

[dcrios](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): {}

UI tweaks, bug fixes.

## Governance

In November the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 14,096 DCR and spent 17,889 DCR. Using November's daily average DCR/USD rate of ${n.nn}, this is ${n}K received and ${n}K spent. At Octobers's average daily rate of ${n.nn}, the USD figure billed for work completed in that month is ${n}K. As of Dec 2, Treasury balance is 640,201 DCR, ($12.4 million USD at $19.44).

There were two new proposals submitted, one for $650 for a DCR version of Point of Sale app [PlusBit](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/e559188b0febcab29c49c1f7dd5c66645e31be00894a150ef7d0b8ceb6486605), and one by @buck54321 requesting $30,000 for continued development of [TinyDecred](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/ad0f9688b3467734e2581604914b2cc32c6eb7991dff460eff41d21f66d88451). Voting started for both proposals on Dec 3.

The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5af0ce1cd325be6be39109c2750f34095c4e8feeea962ede058a1e4f4a61473e) for Latam Marketing and Events by @elian was approved with 75% Yes votes and 29% participation, and the research and education [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/65bde4146b845e7e839d6916d4d8f642bc39c250df5379c2f1e26c4ab778ec1a) by @ammarooni was approved with 80% Yes votes and 29% participation. The Dota2 prize [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5a1bd4116565d107c1672799ed16cae9e92ec633c6e39d9b463b8218e66ff759) was rejected with 5% approval and 29% participation.

@richardred produced a [report](https://www.blockcommons.red/publication/mm-tracking-1/) into the DCR order books from mid-October to mid-November, as i2 Trading started making DCR markets in line with their approved [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2eb7ddb29f151691ba14ac8c54d53f6692c1f5e8fe06244edf7d3c33fb440bd9). The additional liquidity is available, although according to the way it has been measured over this timeframe (where price volatility created difficult conditions), it was probably not available with 90% uptime across all exchanges and pairs.

## Outreach

November featured Decred at a number of high profile events across the world. Many of the same team members from last year returned this year to Websummit in Lisbon, Portugal, where Decred was one of the only crypto projects to exhibit and speak. Marco Peereboom represented the crypto industry on a panel titled, "Can You Trust Your Bank," which can be viewed [here](https://vimeo.com/375884648). [Dominic represented Decred at the 2019 Global Blockchain Summit in Wuzhen, China on November 7-9](https://twitter.com/wanbihou/status/1193218449721311233?s=20). 

Dustorf shared drafts of all new decred.org subpages in the writers room, and after community input, everything has been submitted to Eeter for final assembly, testing and publication. 

The Decred Assembly featured a [Deep Dive on 1.5 rc1 with Dave Collins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQuY0kOt7g) in November, and episodes of Decred in Depth features [Liz Bagot on PR](https://soundcloud.com/decredindepth/ep-11-liz-bagot-pr-marketing) and [Akin Sawyerr on Africa and Governance](https://soundcloud.com/decredindepth/ep-12-akin-sawyerr-dcr-africa-governance).

Coinbase published a [post](https://blog.coinbase.com/how-coinbase-views-proof-of-work-security-f4ba1a139da0) about PoW security, outlining its position that it is advantageous for security that the coin be mined by hardware for which this is the dominant use (i.e. ASICs), and that manufacturing and ownership diversity is well served by ASIC-friendly algorithms. 

The CEO of MicroBT (maker of Whatsminer D1, one of the current top Decred miners) was [arrested](https://insidebitcoins.com/news/chinese-police-conduct-snap-raid-of-microbt-premises-arrests-ceo/242367) in Shenzen, China, in relation to a mining patent infringement.

A bug in Zcash implementation [leaked metadata](https://duke.leto.net/2019/10/01/zcash-metadata-leakage-cve-2019-16930.html) and allowed an attacker to link IP addresses to Zcash shielded addresses (_missed in Oct_). From the developer who discovered it: "All people who use zaddrs and who have shared zaddrs with 3rd parties. (...) Consider your IP address and geo-location information associated with it as tied to your zaddr.". The bug was copied from Bitcoin Core codebase and introduced in Zcash in 2016. The leak was fixed in v2.0.7-3, although the [security announcement](https://z.cash/support/security/announcements/security-announcement-2019-09-24/) just recommended to upgrade immediately without any details. A number of projects inheriting Zcash code are affected as well. This shows that privacy tech is very delicate and requires less error-prone programming approach, extremely thorough review and testing.

The Zcash Foundation and ECC reached [agreement](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/zcash-trademark-resolution/) on how to handle the Zcash trademark. This has been transferred to the Foundation, with an agreement where it shares bilateral power to enforce the mark with ECC. This coindesk [article](https://www.coindesk.com/zcash-trademark-talks-were-about-more-than-a-logo) explains how the dispute was about more than a logo, and the power of the trademark holder to effectively decide which chain is Zcash. 

Decred adds another dimension whereby the legitimacy of the chain is established by voters, and minority forks are heavily disincentivized with significant challenges to overcome. Even if someone attempts to steal the Decred "trademark", there should not be confusion about what the original chain is because voters are signing each block. Also, Decred has a very clear answer to "who exactly is hiring the dev org? what is the 'community'?" - stakeholders.

Resolution of the ZEC trademark issue allowed [polling](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/community-sentiment-collection-poll/) for NU4 to proceed, where the Zcash ecosystem/community can signal support for 13 options to fund development. The EFF and Zcash Foundation will consider the results from 3 [or 4](https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1200917828011876352) different polling methods when deciding what plan to adopt.

Aragon [completed](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-aragon-network-vote-4/) its 4th AGP voting round, 15 proposals were voted on and ANT participation was around 3-18%. Among the approved proposals was [AGP-103](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-103.md), introducing a network budget of 5% Treasury value or 250,000 DAI (whichever is greater) per quarterly voting cycle. The largest proposal to be approved (with 9% turnout, 91% approval) is [AGP-106](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/raw/1bee7c003d2e0dbfdc8cfe698198adeaf2cf0c7b/AGPs/AGP-106.md) to develop and launch Aragon Chain, at a cost of $500,000. The aim is to create a new layer 1 protocol and offer it as an alternative to the Ethereum-based Aragaon network. Among the reasons cited were increasing costs of keeping up with changes to the Ethereum network's changes. [AGP-112](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/raw/1bee7c003d2e0dbfdc8cfe698198adeaf2cf0c7b/AGPs/AGP-112.md), which also passed, issued a proclamation that Aragon is opposed to ProgPoW on Ethereum, or any other non-emergency change to mining algorithm before Ethereum 2.0. The highest turnout proposal was [AGP-81](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/raw/1bee7c003d2e0dbfdc8cfe698198adeaf2cf0c7b/AGPs/AGP-81.md), with 17% of ANT turning out to vote no on a collaboration with Kleros on the court system.

Aragon Court [launched](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-court-is-live-on-mainnet/) on mainnet, it is a system for adjudicating "subjective disputes that cannot be resolved by smart contracts". ANT holders can stake their tokens for ANJ tokens, which can then be staked to participate in adjudication on cases brought before the court. Decisions are made through a Schelling game where those who guess the majority decision are rewarded and those who guess wrong have their stake slashed. Registration to become ANJ jurors is set to begin in Jan 2020.

Dragonfly research published an [article](https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/breaking-mimblewimble-privacy-model-84bcd67bfe52) about "breaking Mimblewimble's privacy model" by monitoring the network in real time. @jy-p had identified this issue as part of his review of privacy solutions, and subsequently discussed it on the base layer [podcast](https://acrabaselayer.podbean.com/e/base-layer-episode-086-jake-yocom-piatt-decred/).

An "Unknown Fund" was [announced](https://www.unknown.fund/press-release), pledging to invest and donate $75 Million in Bitcoin for the startups which directly or indirectly support the idea of anonymity. "Preference will be given to the following niches: protection of personal data, tools for anonymity, cryptocurrency and blockchain." The fund is quite opaque, only saying that "Applications are closed for the Unknown Fund.  Evaluation will take a few months."

The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) [announced](https://www.stellar.org/blog/sdfs-next-steps/) that it had [burned](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/45793/the-stellar-foundation-has-burned-over-50-of-the-total-xlm-token-supply-canceling-airdrop-programs) 55 billion XLM, worth over $4.4 billion (notionally), and representing more than 50% of the entirely pre-mined XLM supply. The stated reasons were a belief that the foundation could achieve its aims with less funding, and that the large scale airdrop campaigns were proving ineffective.

The EOS blockchain [entered](https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-blockchain-congested-eidos-airdrop-95-of-transfers) "congestion mode" due to a surge in transactions related to an airdrop program (EIDOS), which at one stage accounted for 95% of all EOS transactions. One effect is that users who have less staked EOS are unable to make transactions until demand for the airdrop subsides or its CPU lease expires in 30 days. Another effect was a surge of 100,000% in the cost of CPU time on the network.

Block.one [announced](https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-creator-blockone-to-vote-for-block-producers-with-95-of-coins) that it is going to begin voting for block producers with the 9.5% of EOS it controls - classifying itself as a “Small, but significant EOS token holder”. Block.one did not announce how they will be voting.

EOS New York [tweeted](https://twitter.com/eosnewyork/status/1199813240307568641) to uncover the fact that 6 of the registered EOS BPs appear to be operated by the same entity. Although the BPs in question are [not in the top 21 active BPs](https://twitter.com/BlockCommons/status/1200133433009287168), they were receiving rewards regularly as standby BPs.

The Donuts-on-Ethereum experiment of /r/EthTrader is [transitioning](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/dwiu4f/donutsonethereum_registration_is_open/) on chain to an Aragon DAO. Subreddit members had 2 weeks to register to claim their Donuts, starting from Nov 15. As noted in previous issues, the /r/EthTrader community has already fragmented over the way the decentralization of donuts is being handled.

{DEX}

Justin Sun of Tron [revealed](https://www.coindesk.com/despite-denials-tron-founder-confirms-investment-in-poloniex-crypto-exchange) that he is part of an investor group that bought the Poloniex exchange. Later in the month it was [announced](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/48603/poloniex-acquires-tron-based-dex-to-offer-decentralized-trading) that Poloniex had acquired a TRON-based DEX to offer decentralized trading. A few days later the Poloniex twitter account [tweeted](https://beincrypto.com/poloniex-caught-telling-followers-to-buy-tron-in-deleted-tweet/) "Let's buy #TRON", but this tweet was deleted shortly afterwards. 

BitMEX unfortunately [leaked](https://www.coindesk.com/bitmex-exchange-exposes-user-base-in-email-mishap) their email database by sending an email to everyone using cc instead of bcc. Oops. This leads to targeting of users, revealing one aspect of their identity to parties with mal-intent.

Virgin Bitcoins are 10-30% more expensive than Bitcoins with history, according to a [blog](https://medium.com/@official_83664/what-are-virgin-bitcoins-and-where-can-i-buy-them-d6eab0f669e0) by Vertex Marketplace. This should be no surprise to anyone who understands fungibility. {rr: is this a reliable source? it's selling a virgin bitcoin service... doesn't quote anything for the 10-30% markup stat, looks like a probable marketing stunt}

Bittrex has [adopted](https://www.coindesk.com/bittrex-chainalysis-kyt) Chainalysis [Know Your Transaction](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/real-time-alerts-press-release) software that monitors 15 cryptoassets for suspicious activity in real-time. (_missed in Sep_).

{this seem to have been fixed} New and "improved" version of CoinDesk doesn't show any content unless you enable javascript and certain browser features. For readers that don't want to enable them, this means all past content (that was not archived) is no longer accessible. For those who will keep the features enabled this means more browser fingerprinting and attack vectors. For CoinDesk it allows to be less accountable because this way of client-side rendering actively resists the creation of page snapshots by web notaries like web.archive.org or archive.today.

{other: regulations, security, fun}

U.S. Federal Reserve is [hiring](https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-federal-reserve-hiring-new-manager-to-research-digital-currencies) a manager to research digital currencies for up to $250K a year.

{U.S. Fed [announced](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_191114) that they will "offer three additional term repo operations with longer maturities that extend past the end of 2019". This measure is an addition to existing 1-day and 14-day repo operations and purchases of Treasury bills.

If you ever wondered who gets the repo money, you will have to [wait](http://gata.org/node/19583) two years.

The Fed itself [admitted](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/powells-fantasy-the-economy-should-grow-faster-than-debt/) that U.S. national debt growing faster than nominal GDP is "not sustainable", shortly after the debt exceeded $23 trillion. Interestingly, he said it's not the Fed's job to fix it. The debt has two sides. On the one side, someone is creating demand by taking more and more debt. On the other side, the Fed is making the debt drug much more accessible by cutting rates, lending money to banks and "purchasing" assets like stocks and bonds. Something nobody wants to talk about is where the this money comes from.}

U.S. companies are [stacking up cash](https://www.axios.com/businesses-spending-indicators-recession-533481fc-dba7-4b5c-add4-c11628c335bc.html) to prepare for an economic downturn. A notable quote from the Axios story: "Data from the Investment Company Institute shows that even though the stock market has risen by nearly 25% this year, investors have been net sellers of stocks, pulling $100 billion out of equity funds.". A Zero Hedge [article](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/conundrum-2019-equity-outflows-are-biggest-ever-yet-stocks-are-all-time-highs-what-happens) shows a weird phenomena of money flowing out of equities yet the prices keeps setting new ATHs. How is that possible? Some factors making it possible are the companies themselves being the biggest buyers (stock buybacks), central banks creating money that flows into stocks, paired with a simultaneous decline of trading volume.

The "fun" part in these dynamics where investors are [moving to cash](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/world-s-rich-readying-for-major-stock-sell-off-ubs-wealth-says) is that while it saves their value from more risky assets and negative interest rates, it will still be diluted by endless printing of fiat money.

Global debt is hitting all-time highs. The numbers vary by the source: $188 trillion and 230% of the world output figure comes from [IMF chief](https://www.ibtimes.com/global-debt-surges-record-high-188-tn-imf-chief-2861715), while $250 trillion and 320% of world output figure is from [Axios](https://www.axios.com/capital-markets-eye-world-soaring-debt-400f9f37-46b5-45ad-9487-c09ba8958c09.html), which cited Institute of International Finance.

Certain physical security providers report an increased [demand](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-20/world-s-rich-are-rattled-and-looking-for-old-fashioned-security) for safe deposit boxes to store precious metals, cash and cryptocurrency. The motives cited are fears of a global recession, avoidance of negative interest rates and natural disasters.

Several U.S. organizations acted in concert to "deflate the bitcoin bubble of 2017" according to a CoinDesk [story](https://www.coindesk.com/trump-administration-popped-2017-bitcoin-bubble-ex-cftc-chair-says). "One of the untold stories of the past few years is that the CFTC, the Treasury, the SEC and the \[National Economic Council\] director at the time, Gary Cohn, believed that the launch of bitcoin futures would have the impact of popping the bitcoin bubble. And it worked.". While the move is presented as helping the market by "popping the bubble", giving traders the ability to "express a pessimistic view" even if they _don't own_ the asset, and preventing "believer's market", it somewhat reminds of the smart use of futures [in 1974](http://www.gata.org/node/17081) to increase volatility of gold and discourage people from holding it. _(missed in October)_

Czech Central Bank forbids to use the word "coin" and is [prepared](https://www.bitcoininsider.org/article/77479/czech-central-bank-prepares-fine-calling-physical-bitcoins-coins) to fine a company that is calling physical coins containing Bitcoin paper wallets with 0.1 BTC "mince" ("coin" in Czech).

A law has been [passed](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/48738/with-parliament-approval-german-banks-to-sell-and-custody-crypto-in-2020) by the German parliament which will allow banks to sell and custody cryptocurrencies from Jan 1 2020, subject to the required licenses. 

During October [protests](https://twitter.com/dalalmawad/status/1186705664229466112) in Lebanon the banks were [closed](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/23/lebanon-protests-fears-of-a-cash-crisis-as-banks-remain-shut.html) for two weeks for safety reasons. Upon reopening on Nov 1, capital controls were [established](https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/11/07/how-unofficial-capital-controls-stopped-a-run-on-the-banks-in-lebanon/) limiting daily withdrawals and transfers abroad.

GitHub has [removed](https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/github-removes-tsunami-democratics-apk-after-a-takedown-order-from-spain/) the APK of an app for organizing protests in Catalonia, acting on a court takedown request sent by Spain's national police force.

CEO of Mongoila-based IDAX exchange has [disappeared](https://idax.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037327571-Urgent-announcement-about-current-situation-of-IDAX-Global) together with keys from exchange's cold storage. Five days prior to that the exchange has announced withdrawal [problems](https://idax.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036736211-Announcement-of-IDAX-withdrawal-channel-congestion) and that it will no longer serve users in [China](https://idax.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036736691-IDAX-no-longer-provide-services-for-users-in-China). This is reminiscent of the case of Canadian QuadrigaCX whose CEO  mysteriously disappeared, also with the keys. The takeaways here are: have several backup people with the keys if you run an important service, screen your exchange and ideally, contribute to replacing custodial exchanges with [non-custodial](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) ones.

A trojan-enabled version of Tor browser was [targeting](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/18/fleecing-onion-trojanized-tor-browser/) Bitcoin users, discovered by ESET. The trojan version was spreading from `tor-browser[.]org` and `torproect[.]org` domains.

The prominent getmonero.org site was [compromised](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/official-monero-website-is-hacked-to-deliver-currency-stealing-malware/) and wallet binaries were replaced with malicious code. The issue was identified by a user who checked the signature and found it didn't match, then promptly [fixed](https://web.getmonero.org/2019/11/19/warning-compromised-binaries.html) by the Monero team. At least one user reported losing funds.

A fake Zcash wallet was [distributed](https://twitter.com/mineZcash/status/1185908172105453568) through a github.su domain (_missed in Oct_).

Another fake Decred wallet was noticed, reported and quickly removed by GitHub. The account named `decreds` and the way the fake [v1.5.0 release](https://archive.today/ivVRO) was published looked surprisingly similar to previous "v1.5.0 Mandatory Update" by `DecredCoin` covered in [September](201909.md). Looks like hackers can't wait for v1.5 final. We too! If you encounter anything like this on GitHub or elsewhere, please report it to the platform immediately, and let the community know too to minimize possible damage.

If you couldn't upload enough of your data to Google, it is [rumored](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/google-reportedly-offering-checking-accounts-next-year.html) to get into the banking business and offer checking accounts next year. Project codename "Cache" is a bit ironical because in computing caches are often wiped.
