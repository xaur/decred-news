  - "If we had a robust, both Sybil-resistant and anonymous voting system, then we wouldn’t even be having this conversation," Mann told CoinDesk.
  - In Decred, there is another dimension where legitimacy of the chain is established by voters. Minority forks are heavily disincentivized. Even if someone attempts to steal the Decred "trademark", there will never be confusion about what the original chain is because voters are signing each block. Also, Decred has a very clear answer to "who exactly is hiring the dev org? what is the 'community'?" - stakeholders.
