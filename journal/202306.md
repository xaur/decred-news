### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

New work that was included in the new 1.8.0 release:

General:

- Update [Go CI and Go linter](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/ab6d284362de7a30f623289bb1523ecc395c18ca)
- Update modules: [addrmgr](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3121), [blockchain](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3133), [blockchain/standalone](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3120), [blockchain/stake](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3131), [chaincfg](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3125), [connmgr](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3124), [database](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3130), [dcrutil](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3129), [gcs](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3132), [hdkeychain](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3127), [peer](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3128), [rpcclient](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3134), [txscript](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3126), [wire](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3119), and the [main module](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3138).
- Update the latest block which has been externally [verified to be valid](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3122), as well as the [minimum known chain work](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3123) (which speeds up initial blockchain downloads)
- Update [RPC integration tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3118).
- If the majority of the network upgrades, miners will [generate new block versions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3136), and  [nodes will reject old block versions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3135).
- Modify the vote logic so that, after block height 777240, [stakers no longer approve blocks with old block versions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3137). This change forces miners to upgrade to the latest block version in a timely fashion so that voting on the new consensus changes can commense.
- [Remove module replacements](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3139), and [release 1.8.0](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3140).

DCP-11: Change PoW to BLAKE3 and ASERT

Full PR with commits and comments [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3115), but the major changes included:

- Make the _block hash_ and _proof of work hash_ [separate and independent](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/dbb6b782e0580395b3cb05333233994a70196ae7) so that each hash can be modified without changing the other.
- Add [BLAKE3 support](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/66a59e0d9248632575d57cf26f5f338ed60ed9f5) and split methods for computing the old PowHashV1 (BLAKE256) and the new [PowHashV2 (BLAKE3)](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/b2878aa5c18a1a5669f769d594ec3fc4954aa779).
- [Updates](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/6c323c18b0eb7e4035c8ceb4ac3a36230c8c9c42) to the `getwork` RPC and `notifywork` websocket notification.
- Add the [ASERT difficulty calculation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/d9b1921177d4626a22c380853d6c7030a2d5c854) and  algorithm for miners to [generate blocks](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/2db55eb6e7d16aca5676cd7d473555d23b30e23f) with the correct difficulty.
- Implement the DCP-11 [consensus vote](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/85e3701a67fa5a9a7eb418ce71fa991ede447dbb) `blake3pow`.

In addition to the BLAKE3 PoW hash change which will make current Decred ASIC miners useless, the new ASERT difficulty adjustment algorithm will adjust the difficulty with each new block instead of every 144 blocks (the current adjustment frequency). For reference, Bitcoin's mining difficulty is updated every 2,016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks.

The ASERT difficulty algorithm is also exponential, and can handle surging activity much better than the existing algorithm. This will greatly disincentivize "hit and run" miners who are only looking for a quick reward at a low difficulty. The network is stronger when miners are consistently creating new blocks. [Reference discussion on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!uCnoeYfbhUnvwWihzS:decred.org/$tbF9LyO1EzQ8m3JDHfX9EYnQz1zr8W0Ra73Yjtprj1M).

{
  I'd like to include the top picture from https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3115 here
  (The picture which shows all three difficulty scenarios at once)
  But I don't know the process for saving pictures in certain filetypes and sizes. The original picture is a large .svg.
}

For reference, the work for [DCP-12](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0012/dcp-0012.mediawiki): Change PoW/PoS Subsidy Split to 1/89, was completed and discussed in the [April](202304.md#dcrd) issue.

Like all previous consensus changes, the consensus code will remain dormant and only activate if the respective [voting agendas](https://voting.decred.org/) pass.

The following work has been merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Bump the master branch to [version 1.9.0-pre](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3141).
- Use latest [dcrtest](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3142), and clean up [unused required modules](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3143).
- Update [docker image](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3146) to golang:1.20.5-alpine3.18.
- Add [release notes for v1.8.0](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3144).
- Clean up [database test logic](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3147).
- Add [release notes templates](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3148).
- Add [CI support](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3145) for test and module caches, which will result in faster CI runs.
- Update [module hierarchy diagram](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3149) to accurately reflect module dependencies.
- [Improve test flag handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3151), especially in cases where default home directories are inaccessible (such as with Nix) and need to be changed. Additionally, a [DCRD_APPDATA environment variable](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3152) can now be used to override the default directory.

All work reported below is merged to `master` towards the next release (likely v0.1.8).

GUI and CLI apps:

- Create new group chats [version 1](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/263) by default. This is the latest version that supports multiple admins in the chat.
- [Persist](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/257) received but not fully processed group chat messages. This helps to show messages in the correct order esp. after restarts.
- Reduced max number of [idle HTTP connections](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/281) from 100 to 2. HTTP connections to the "normal web" are used to fetch DCR/BTC and BTC/USD exchange rates.
- Made server [reconnection loop](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/290) faster.
- Fixed some issues with [key exchanges](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/273) (KX). Improved reporting of completed KX in direct and group chats. Avoid multiple KX attempts with same user when joining multiple group chats. Added automatic KX attempts when sending messages to group chat members, this should fix message delivery issues due to missed KX with target user.

GUI app:

- Added [Address Book](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/256) that lists all known users and group chats. Recent chats list was optimized to hide empty chats and show newer chats on top. Hidden empty chats can be brought back from the address book.
- Added [search and filter](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/264) function to the Address Book page.
- Added ability to [hide non-empty chats](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/264). Hidden chats can be shown again via the address book.
- Create [config directory](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/259) if it is missing.
- Store and load [invoices](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/282) to better track tip status across app restarts.
- Improved [sorting of Feed posts](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/288) to take recent comments into account.
- Improved post [commenting UX](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/291) to better visualize if the user is leaving a top-level comment or a reply to other comment.
- Refined [chat list UX](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/292) { _clarify_ }
- Optimized [vertical space](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/293) on inbound and outbound channel pages.
- Updated [Flutter](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/258) dependencies.
- Refactoring { 259 - snackbar, 270 - snackbar }
- Fixed loading of history for contacts that have [not completed key exchange](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/257).
- Fixed a bug that could prevent errors from being properly [shown](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/271) on the onboarding page.
- Fixed a bug where the Chats page was not aware of [hidden chats](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/276) and would erroneously show "Funds Needed" or "Invite Needed" pages.
- Fixed [suggest KX](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/277) not working properly. This also adds hidden users to the dropdown.
- Fixed possibility to open [multiple file pickers](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/262) in places like creating posts or generating invites.

CLI app:

- Allow to create a new post from an [existing file](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/253) with the `/post new` command.
- Allow to author posts and comments in an [external text editor](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/253) as configured in the `$EDITOR` environment variable.
- Allow to [embed files](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/253) in posts and comments by adding `localfilename` directive, which will be replaced with file's contents.
- Allow to [confirm comments](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/253) before sending them.
- Added command to [set exchange rates manually](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/272) and reduced log verbosity for failures to fetch rates from dcrdata and Bittrex.
- Fixed [duplicated messages](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/254) in new chat windows.

Stores:

- Added a page to see information about one [order](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/255).
- Allow store [admin](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/260) and [customer](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/283) to add comments to the order, and show them on both admin and customer order pages.

Preparations for mobile app builds:

- Configured the embedded dcrlnd to [not include IP or hostname](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/267) in generated TLS certificates. This is needed to make the Android version compile. { _maybe further explain or group_ }
- Updated [gomobile](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/267) library.
- Fixed [compilation of `golib`](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/267) with gomobile. `golib` is an adapter for the low level Bison Relay code in Go for reuse by the high level GUI code, which is written in Dart and Flutter.
- Moved and adapted some [desktop code](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/267) to a shared location to enable reuse on mobile. { _reword or group_ }
- Made multiple changes specific to [iOS and Android builds](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/267).
- First pass of making views [responsive](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/285) and usable on smaller screens and mobile platforms. A more thorough design implementation will be done in the future once UX specs are finalized.

Developer and internal changes:

- Added script to [update version](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/274) information in all 6 files that need it. { _group_ }
- Updated Decred and third party [Go dependencies](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/268). { _also 278; group_ }
- Refactored GitHub [build config](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/280). { _group_ }
- Code [cleanup](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/279). { _group_ }
- Refactored [config parsing](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/289) to use INI sections. { _group_ }

## Relevant External

Bittrex US was [allowed](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/14/bankrupt-crypto-exchange-bittrex-us-set-to-allow-withdrawals-starting-thursday/) to re-open customer withdrawals, these would usually be frozen during liquidation but Bittrex argued to allow customers to withdraw their funds and a judge agreed, although stating that this did not make a determination that the customers (still) owned the assets and there may be clawbacks as the liquidation process continues.

The SEC has [sued](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/05/sec-sues-crypto-exchange-binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao/) Binance and CZ in a long-anticipated move which declares a number of the assets Binance lists as securities and alleges that they were allowing US citizens to trade on the platform, even encouraging the whales. The SEC's [complaint](https://downloads.coindesk.com/legal/Binance.pdf) lists 10 crypto tokens with a page or more of explanation about its origins and why the SEC considers it a security. The tokens listed as securities are: SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, and COTI.

The "Electric Coin Company" (ECC) has announced (in May) that it is [restructuring](https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/) to serve Zcash in different ways, with a much smaller team (13 staff, 50% are being made redundant) and focused on core specialisms like the transition to Proof of Stake consensus. Many of the functions of the ECC will be transferred to other entities within the ZEC community. 

MakerDAO has [voted](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/01/makerdao-votes-to-ditch-500m-in-paxos-dollar-stablecoin-from-reserve-assets/) to remove the USDP stablecoin provided by Paxos from its reserves, these currently include $500 Million of USDP and that is half of the token's supply.

Payment processor Mastercard has set up a testbed dubbed the "[Multi-Token Network](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/28/mastercard-is-piloting-tokenized-bank-deposits-in-new-uk-testbed/)" (MTN) for tokenizing bank deposits, turning them into digital tokens on blockchains which are programmable like crypto tokens. A beta version of MTN will be available to industry partners in the UK from summer 2023 and they are setting up an innovation spring where selected teams will be given access to MTN so they can develop use cases. Mastercard plans to experiment with stablecoins and CBDCs on MTN also.

Binance has [reversed](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-relists-privacy-coins-in-europe) its decision to delist several privacy-oriented crypto-assets for users from some European countries to comply with the new MiCA regulations. After listening to user feedback and from the communities for those projects, they decided they could continue to support them as they have transparent public ledgers.

Binance is also working to [integrate](https://twitter.com/binance/status/1671042638592589826) Bitcoin Lightning Network for deposits and withdrawals.

Watchers of CRV [noted](https://twitter.com/scott_lew_is/status/1669057317684359170) on twitter that over 30% of its circulating supply had been deposited as collatoral for loans in the AAVE protocol by one user, the founder, prompting concern that if the position were liquidated the market would be flooded with CRV and the Aave protocol would end up with a lot of bad debt. The CRV price did decline further but the borrower in question [repaid](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/15/wallet-linked-to-curve-founder-repays-13m-to-aave-amid-crv-token-decline/) some of the debt and decreased the liquidation risk. 

Many users of Atomic Wallet had their assets [stolen](https://decrypt.co/143362/atomic-wallet-attack-exploit-investigation) in an apparent hack on June 3, with early estimates of $35 million and [later](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1668778031790587905) $100 million of the losses incurred by users. However, it remains unclear what the cause of the hack was, and a blog post from the wallet's developers on June 22 left a lot of [unanswered](https://cointelegraph.com/news/atomic-wallet-hack-statement-exploit-unanswered-questions) questions - they offered four possibilities for how users funds were stolen but weren't sure which one was the real cause. They suggested that all of the thefts occurred on June 3, but they are just going from user testimony and reports the same as the community researchers who have been looking into it and giving more timely updates.

Users of the web 3 betting platform Polymarket have drawn [attention](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/titanic-submarine-online-gambling-cryptocurrency-b2363328.html) for [gambling](https://protos.com/crypto-is-betting-on-the-missing-titan-sub-and-its-looking-bearish/) on the outcome of the lost Titan submersible, with several hundred thousand dollars worth of cryptocurrency being wagered, making it the site's most active market at the time. The Polymarket [event](https://polymarket.com/event/will-the-missing-submarine-be-found-by-june-23) betting on whether the Titan submersible would be found by June 23 went to dispute resolution after resolving to "Yes" when pieces of the submarine were indeed found, but several [stories](https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/gamblers-bet-titan-sub/) about the event reference people making money from "betting that the Titan submersible would not be found". It has not been possible to locate the dispute resolution outcome on Polymarket itself.

_2. Order the stories as follows:_

- _Crypto L1 tech: PoW, ASIC resistance, full nodes, network security, etc._
- _Crypto L2+ tech: "Smart" contracts, DEX projects_
- _Crypto governance, finances, transparency, funding, chain forks, community splits_
