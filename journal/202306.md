### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

First let's look at the changes included in the new 1.8.0 release.

General:

- Updated [Go CI and Go linter](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/ab6d284362de7a30f623289bb1523ecc395c18ca).
- Released new module versions as part of the regular release cycle. Developers building on top of dcrd can now consume the following updated Go modules: [addrmgr](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3121), [blockchain](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3133), [blockchain/standalone](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3120), [blockchain/stake](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3131), [chaincfg](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3125), [connmgr](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3124), [database](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3130), [dcrutil](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3129), [gcs](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3132), [hdkeychain](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3127), [peer](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3128), [rpcclient](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3134), [txscript](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3126), [wire](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3119), and the [main module](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3138).
- Updated integration test framework (dcrtest) and [re-enabled treasury test](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3118). It was [temporarily disabled](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/3093) to get around the circular dependency issue.
- Miners running v1.8 will [generate new block versions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3136) (10), and if the majority of the network upgrades [nodes will reject old block versions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3135) (9).
- Modified vote notification logic so that, after block height 777,240, stake voters will [no longer approve blocks with old block versions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3137). This is achieved by making dcrd not sent new block notifications to connected RPC clients, such as voting wallets. This change forces miners to upgrade to the latest block version in a timely fashion so that voting on the new consensus changes can commence.
- [Removed module replacements](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3139), and [released 1.8.0](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3140). { _may group or drop_ }
- Updated the [`AssumeValid`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3122) block and [`MinKnownChainWork`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3123) as part of the regular release development cycle.

For reference, as of [May 2022](202205.md#development), `AssumeValid` has replaced the legacy "checkpoints" method to optimize initial blockchain downloads. With `AssumeValid`, very old blockchain forks are rejected, and some validation checks are skipped for blocks which are ancestors of the assumed valid block. This can significantly speed up initial blockchain downloads. The updates to `AssumeValid` and `MinKnownChainWork` are externally verified and hardcoded by the devs, and used by default without any action required by node admins. Note: It is possible to change this behavior using the flags `--allowoldforks` and `--assumevalid` as described in `dcrd --help` or [in the code](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/255ef183f66567f1e623026eb524f9cd26fd2b23/chaincfg/mainnetparams.go#L129), but this is not recommended for typical node admins.

{ _what does `MinKnownChainWork` do? can it be disabled like `AssumeValid` and what are the implications?_ }

Next are some major changes implementing the DCP-11, [Change PoW to BLAKE3 and ASERT](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3115):

- Made the _block hash_ and _proof of work hash_ [separate and independent](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/dbb6b782e0580395b3cb05333233994a70196ae7) so that each hash can be modified without changing the other. A great practical consequence is that _block hash_ consensus will remain unchanged with DCP-11, meaning that all software which handles block hashes will need no modification. Smaller, focused upgrades mean minimal downstream effects for consumers.
- Added [support](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/66a59e0d9248632575d57cf26f5f338ed60ed9f5) for the [BLAKE3 hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)#BLAKE3) and split methods for computing the old PowHashV1 (BLAKE256) and the new [PowHashV2 (BLAKE3)](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/b2878aa5c18a1a5669f769d594ec3fc4954aa779). Notable, it's not possible to completely remove PowHashV1 and other old-consensus code. Even when blockchain consensus changes, it must remain possible to validate the old chain. Therefore, legacy concensus code is maintained to be able to validate the past 7 years of the Decred blockchain prior to newer consensus changes. The third party dependency chosen for BLAKE3 is [lukechampine.com/blake3](https://pkg.go.dev/lukechampine.com/blake3) - an implementation that balances performance and code readability, hoping to eventually land in Go standard library. In addition to pure-Go version, the package also provides AVX-512 and AVX2 routines for increased performance. Another added dependency is [cpuid](https://github.com/klauspost/cpuid) - a Go package for detecting available CPU features.
- [Updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/6c323c18b0eb7e4035c8ceb4ac3a36230c8c9c42) the `getwork` command and `notifywork` websocket notification. These are used by the mining code to fetch new data for hashing.
- Added the [ASERT difficulty calculation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/d9b1921177d4626a22c380853d6c7030a2d5c854) and algorithm for miners to [generate blocks](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/2db55eb6e7d16aca5676cd7d473555d23b30e23f) with the correct difficulty.
- Implemented the DCP-11 [consensus vote](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/85e3701a67fa5a9a7eb418ce71fa991ede447dbb). It will show up as `blake3pow` in voting software.

In addition to the BLAKE3 PoW hash change which will make current Decred ASIC miners useless, the new ASERT algorithm will adjust the difficulty with each new block instead of every 144 blocks (the current adjustment frequency). For reference, Bitcoin's mining difficulty is updated every 2,016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks. ASERT stands for Absolutely Scheduled Exponentially weighted Rising Targets.

The ASERT difficulty algorithm is also exponential, and can handle surging activity much better than the existing algorithm. This will greatly disincentivize "hit and run" miners who are only looking for a quick reward at a low difficulty. ASERT also better handles [large drops of hashrate](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3115#discussion_r1205741807) which cause slow blocks and degraded user experience. The network is stronger when miners are consistently creating new blocks and maintain the target block time of 5 minutes. See also the relevant [discussion on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!uCnoeYfbhUnvwWihzS:decred.org/$tbF9LyO1EzQ8m3JDHfX9EYnQz1zr8W0Ra73Yjtprj1M). For those who love fast math and bit tricks, make sure to read the [ASERT code here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/d9b1921177d4626a22c380853d6c7030a2d5c854/blockchain/standalone/pow.go#L222).

For reference, the work for DCP-12 "Change PoW/PoS Subsidy Split to 1/89" was completed and discussed in the [April](202304.md#dcrd) issue. The DCP itself has been reviewed and [published](https://github.com/decred/dcps/pull/28) in June, it is now [available in the DCPs repository](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0012/dcp-0012.mediawiki).

Like all previous consensus changes, the consensus code will remain dormant and only activate if the respective [voting agendas](https://voting.decred.org/) pass.

The following work has been merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Bumped the master branch to [version 1.9.0-pre](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3141). { _group or drop_ }
- Updated to use latest [dcrtest](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3142), and excluded [unused modules](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3143) from regular builds.
- Updated the [Docker image](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3146) to build the dcrd binary with newer Go and Alpine Linux. It's noteworthy to mention that the dcrd Docker template does not persist the Alpine Linux OS. After building the binary, the OS is removed, and dcrd runs in a `scratch` Docker container by itself. No OS, no root user, not even a shell. A lightweight [container with maximum security](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/4aa67947b5b36d40bb146d5ecacb76dcb7f50a7f/contrib/docker).
- Added [release notes for v1.8.0](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3144).
- Cleaned up [database test logic](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3147).
- Added [release notes templates](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3148).
- Added [CI support](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3145) for test and module caches, which will result in faster CI runs. CI is Continuous Integration, a service that *continuously* builds and tests the code to ensure all changes *integrate* well. Faster CI runs reduce developers' wait time to see if their changes pass all tests. The cache cuts CI run time from ~10 to ~1 minute.
- Updated [module hierarchy diagram](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3149) to accurately reflect module dependencies.
- [Improved test flag handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3151), especially in cases where default home directories are inaccessible (such as with NixOS) and need to be changed. Additionally, a [`DCRD_APPDATA`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3152) environment variable can now be used to override the default directory. Environment variables are generally the preferred approach for overriding defaults in containers.

Changes merged in the [dcrtest](https://github.com/decred/dcrtest) framework:

- Updated [linters](https://github.com/decred/dcrtest/pull/13). { _may group_ }
- Updated the voting wallet to support [DCP-12](https://github.com/decred/dcrtest/pull/12) block reward split semantics on simnet.
- Updated the voting wallet to support [DCP-11](https://github.com/decred/dcrtest/pull/14) proof of work semantics on simnet.
- Updated to use latest released [Decred module](https://github.com/decred/dcrtest/pull/15) dependencies and latest [main dcrd module](https://github.com/decred/dcrtest/pull/16).

### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

Changes that were included in the new 1.8.0 release:

- Ensure that the wallet can correctly validate blocks mined with either the [original BLAKE-256 or the upcoming BLAKE3](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2240) proof of work hashes, and updated the vote version.
- Updated [dcrd and cspp modules](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2241) to their latest versions. dcrwallet v3.0.0 module has been released for consumers like vspd, DCRDEX, or Politeia. { _skip 2242 (minor)_ }
- Mixed ticket purchases now have a [random 20-60s delay](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2244) before the wallet publishes each transaction to the mempool. This trickle effect will improve privacy by making it much harder for anyone surveilling the mempool to link tickets together based on published timestamp.

The following work has been merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Removed mention of legacy [ticket revocations](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2245). { _group or drop (too small)_ }
- Updated [.gitignore](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2246) to ignore test databases. { _group (internal/dev)_ }
- Updated the [README](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2247) for people building from source.
- Bumped the major module version of the in-dev [dcrwallet module](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2248) to v4 to prepare for future changes. { _group (internal/dev)_ }
- [Updated tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2250) to account for Go 1.21 changes. { _may group (tests)_ }
- Dropped [noisy TSpend logs](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2251) in SPV mode that were used for development. { _group (too small)_ }
- Removed an [unneeded test](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2253) for the database upgrade code. { _group (tests)_ }
- Removed a deprecated [`AddressReuse` config](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2258) option from the wallet. { _1. add that it was removed from use earlier but was left in code for compatibility; 2. optional: find an earlier removal/deprecation commit and explain what this config did_ }

Works to consolidate VSP code in the vspd repository:

- Brought dcrwallet up to date with vspd, and [reduced dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2238) between the VSP client and dcrwallet.
- Removed a [redundant VSP pubkey check](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2255). { _group (VSP refactor)_ }
- [Added new tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2254) for encoding and decoding VSP data { _may group (tests)_ }
- Made the VSP client responsible for the [VSP logger](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2256), rather than using a global logger. { _group (VSP refactor)_ }
- Cleaned up several VSP functions, as well as [fixed how VSP client handles contexts](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2252). { _group (VSP refactor)_ }
- Moved the logic of [selecting unmanaged tickets](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2257) out of the VSP client module and into the wallet module.


### dcrctl

_[dcrctl](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl) is a command-line client for dcrd and dcrwallet._

- Updates for the v1.8.0 release: use the latest released [dcrd and dcrwallet modules](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/pull/60) so that all their new functionality can be accessed.


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

Changes that were included in the new 1.8.0 release:

- Updated DCRDEX to the [v0.6.1 release](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3871).
- Updated [app metadata](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3872) for official publications, as part of the [work done](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/pull/106493) to add Decrediton to the [winget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Package_Manager) package repository.
- [Removed staking pages for hardware wallets](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3870), since they can't participate in staking. Also added warnings to not use hardware wallets to receive staking or treasury funds, since hardware wallets can't spend those funds.
- Added in-app [release notes](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3878) for v1.8.0.
- Updated [Polish translation](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3850).
- Other minor updates and fixes including some typos, and bumping dependencies. { 3863, 3856, 3868, 3849, 3875, 3877 }
- Fixed an error that occurs when people break the connection between Decrediton and the DEX wallet. The default behavior when using the DEX from Decrediton is that there is only one wallet controlled by Decrediton and the DEX simply uses that. However, it's possible for users to break that connection and force the DEX wallet type to "SPV", which creates a brand new wallet fully managed by the DEX. Decrediton's main wallet will still work, but it can no longer control the new wallet created by the DEX and will throw errors in certain cases. The [error is fixed](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3866) by not allowing Decrediton to attempt to change password on the DEX wallet it no longer controls. However, users should still avoid this uncommon configuration and not change the wallet type from within the DEX plugin.

The following work has been merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Updated [web dependencies](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3876).
- Updated to [Electron v23.3.8](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3884) from v18.3.15. Among other things, this allows Decrediton to communicate with USB devices, which is required for some hardware wallets like Ledger. Since [WebUSB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebUSB) is built-in to the newer versions of Electron, it means devs don't have to use external dependencies, which is good for security.
- Updated to [DEX v0.6.2](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3882), which is required to follow the Decred 1.8.0 hard forks due to consensus changes. In addition, this fixes the "response buffer too short" error reported by some users.
- Updated the [Arabic translation](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3847).
- Fixed placeholder text in the [intro tutorials](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3881). This also adds proper release artwork for v1.8.

In progress:

- As mentioned [last month](202305.md#decrediton), work is ongoing to [add Ledger support](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/3865), particularly the [Ledger UI](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3874). The most interesting new developments for June have been work to add the Ledger [backend functions](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3869) so that the UI can actually interact with the Ledger itself. The primary difficulty isn't simply verifying that the functions work as intended, but rather [removing as many dependencies](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3869#discussion_r1221483673) as possible to reduce the massive risk of dependency [supply chain attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack). Ledger software uses [numerous dependencies](https://npmgraph.js.org/?q=%40ledgerhq%2Fhw-app-btc), and if any of those dependencies were to be compromised by a bad actor, it could put wallet security at risk. Therefore, the Decred devs are taking great care to get this integration right.


### Politeia

_[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia) is Decred's proposal system. It is used to request funding from the Decred treasury._

- Internal dev updates: require either [Go 1.19 or 1.20](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1690); [improved](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1691) [linting](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1692) [and](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1693) [logging](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1689).
- [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1688) where the Politeia webserver would crash when trying to process a new user's registration payment if the transaction couldn't be found. Now, if the transaction cannot be found, the server will simply respond that the user hasn't paid yet. 


### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software used by Voting Service Providers. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

Changes that were included in the [v1.2.0 release](https://github.com/decred/vspd/releases/tag/release-v1.2.0):

- Internal dev updates: updated [linters](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/384), refactored [database encoding](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/384), updated to use latest [dcrd](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/387) and [dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/388) [modules](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/392) in the client and in the [server](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/389), updated Gin [web framework](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/391). { _dropped 385 (enough links for dep updates)_ }
- [Polished](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/390) the vspd admin docs and added new [release notes](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/393) which include notable changes since March 2022 and upgrade instructions.

Changes merged to `master` towards future releases:

- Internal dev updates: bumped [dev version](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/394) and updated [.gitignore](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/396). { _drop (small)_ }
- Updated the admin web UI to show [human-readable fee transactions](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/397) instead of just raw bytes. This quality-of-life improvement for VSP admins also included some extra features like a nicer ticket search input and better JSON formatting.


### dcrpool

_[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool) is server software for running a mining pool._

- Updated [CI config and dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/340) to use Go 1.20, PostgreSQL 15, dcrd and dcrwallet modules from v1.8.0 release, newer third party dependencies, and enabled additional code checkers (aka linters).


### Lightning Network

_[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant and low-cost transactions._

- Updated [CI configs](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/183) for normal builds and Docker builds.
- Bumped version to [v0.4.0](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/171) to reflect breaking changes since v0.3.8.
- Updated to use latest [dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/184) and [dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/171) modules from v1.8.0 release.
- Switched tests from the old `rpctest` package from dcrd repository to use the new [dcrtest](https://github.com/decred/dcrtest) framework.
- Updated output of `dcrlncli --version` to be [consistent](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/185) with other Decred software.
- Improved [startup time](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/186) of dcrlnd and ported a few upstream changes to make it easier. The optimization is based on providing fast access to in-flight payments and skipping the expensive scan of all historical payments on startup.
- Fixed tests { 171 }.


### cspp

_[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp) is a server for coordinating coin mixes using the CoinShuffle++ protocol. It is non-custodial, i.e. never holds any funds. CSPP is part of StakeShuffle, Decreds privacy system._

- Changed mix server's [send and receive timeouts](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/82) to be calculated ahead of time based on the start of the mix. This implements a more robust schedule of deadlines of each step of the mixing protocol. Client-side timeouts have been greatly increased. Clients don't need to precisely track protocol deadlines because they are coordinated by the server. Bigger client-side timeouts allow flexibility to adjust deadlines on the server without having to update client software.
- Updated [dependencies](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/96).
- Added [`StartSolver`](https://github.com/decred/cspp/commit/ea898fb6341ed8173f7cf51f8542a4df1d7e19ae) function which allows RPC clients to start the solver background process and detect its startup issues earlier before beginning a mixing session.


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

Changed included in the v0.6.2 release:

- Improved [help text explaining bonds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2402) in the registration flow. This is based on feedback from the community and other users new to Decred
- BTC: Optimized the [initial deposit required for bonds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2392) to be much lower, around 0.004 BTC ($100) versus 0.06 BTC ($1,500). This will make it easier to onboard new users.
- Updated to latest dcrd and dcrwallet [modules](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2403) from the v1.8.0 release.
- Enabled use of [external fees information](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2391) for SPV wallets such as built-in DEX wallets or Electrum wallets. This works for BTC-based assets: BTC, LTC, and BCH. Before this change it was possible to pay unreasonably [high fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2354) in some scenarios.
- Optimized loading of [static GUI assets](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2398) in the browser. CSS files, JavaScript files, images, and fonts will now load faster.
- Fixed a bug where registration flow could proceed [without waiting for sufficient bond funds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2392) to be deposited.
- Fixed a bug where the Settings page was using incorrect [fund amounts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2402) for bonds.
- Added a workaround for Badger database [truncation error](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2389) which may happen on [Windows](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger/issues/744). { _opt: explain what is "value log truncation" and if it may cause data loss_ }

All changes reported below are towards the next release.

Client:

- Added support for [HTTPS connection](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2345) between client's front-end (browser UI) and back-end (the `dexc` process). When `dexc` is running on a public network HTTPS is enabled by default, otherwise it can be forced with `--webtls` flag. The browser will show a scary warning about a self-signed certificate but it can be overridden.
- Added [tooltips](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2357) to explain various wallet balances (Available, Locked, Immature, Bond Reserves).
- [Updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2383) the [Client Installation and Configuration](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/wiki/Client-Installation-and-Configuration) wiki page to make it clearer, more concise, and up-to-date with the latest release. One notable addition is a table summary of wallet types supported for each asset.
- Added a system tray option to [keep the DEX running](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2367) even after all windows are closed.
- Fixed a bug where [Accelerate button](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2414) was showing for revoked (canceled) trades.

Bitcoin:

- Implemented a function to [place multiple orders in one go](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2362). This will be used by the market making bots and may unlock trading optimizations.
- [Recycle unused](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2368) redemption and refund addresses. DEX generates new Bitcoin addresses to be used for redemptions (trade completed normally) and refunds (trade was canceled and refunded). Many addresses end up being unused. In Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets this may create *gaps* between used addresses that are bigger than the [gap limit](https://blog.lopp.net/mind-the-bitcoin-address-gap/), which may cause problems with discovering funds and restoring wallets from seed. To avoid exceeding the gap limit, generated addresses that were not used for redemptions or refunds will be saved and used for future trades.
- Fixed a [crash](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2396) of the built-in BTC wallet when syncing. Testing DEX walllets [revealed](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1690) a [crash](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcwallet/issues/827) in the upstream btcwallet code. DEX developers contributed to investigating and [fixing](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcwallet/pull/870) it.

Polygon (MATIC):

- Implemented several low-level primitives and [test harness](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2399) to aid in developing Polygon support. The harness was able to sync balances and send funds on simnet and tesnet. Existing Ethereum code has been refactored to be more generic and reusable by Polygon code.
- Extended the [test harness](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2413) to create two nodes, connect them together, and mine blocks.

App packaging:

- Added packaging scripts to build a [DMG installer for macOS](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2333).
- Created a [DCRDEX package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dcrdex) in Arch User Repository (AUR). On Arch or Arch-based Linux distributions like Manjaro it can be installed with an optimistic command like `$ yay dcrdex`. Documentation has been [updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2347) with a list of existing and upcoming packages for various packaging systems.

Server:

- Changed order limits to be [based on bond strength](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2411). Increasing the bond tier by locking more funds will unlock bigger order sizes. Order limit is also reduced by bad behavior like not completing the swaps. This change should fix inability to submit orders for some users. The penalty and reward system is still a work in progress.

Developer and internal changes:

- Updated simnet blockchain with [new proof of work](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2358). { _group_ }
- Updated [linters](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2375). { _group_ }
- Support more flexible [golangci configuration](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2393). { _group_ }
- Added [release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2394) for v0.6.1. { _group_ }
- Added scripts to automatically [update cache busters](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2363). { _optional: Cache busters are special numbers put in web pages that force pages to use latest resources like CSS or JS, and not their possibly outdated versions cached by the browser. A common annoyance during the development is the error-prone manual task of updating these busters, which is now automated._ } { _follow-ups: 2410_ }
- Enabled [caching](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2390) of Go build outputs produced by GitHub Actions. This avoids many unnecessary recompilation and speeds up builds and tests, which run for every pull request. As a result, it takes less time to see if a change being developed breaks any tests.
- Fixed [duplicate network ID](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2378) for DGB and DOGE regnets. { _group_ }

{ _image candidates: 2395 (bond help), 2383 (wallet summary)_ }


### dcrdata

_[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata) is an explorer for Decred blockchain and off-chain data like Politeia proposals, markets, and more._

- Updated [CI build config](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1966), Docker config, and linters.
- Updated to use latest [dcrd modules](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1968) released in v1.8.0. This makes dcrdata and its clients like Decrediton aware of the new consensus votes, and also adds them to the [Agendas page](https://dcrdata.decred.org/agendas).
- Updated [block rewards](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1969) math to be aware of the DCP-12 activation date, as well the new block reward split.
- Fixed a bug where TSpend transactions were included in [coin supply](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1964) data shown on Charts page. Combined with a fix for [coin supply reporting](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3112) in dcrd this fixes supply discrepancy between dcrdata's [Home](https://dcrdata.decred.org/) and [Charts](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts) pages.

{ _image candidates: 1968 (maybe)_ }


### Timestamply

_[Timestamply](https://github.com/decred/dcrtimegui) is a free service for timestamping files powered by Decred blockchain. A timestamp proves that a certain file has existed at a certain moment of time. This has a range of applications in protecting data integrity._

- Updated dcrtime to [build and test against Go 1.20](https://github.com/decred/dcrtime/pull/91) and use latest Decred modules.
- Timestamply is now available at a shorter domain: [timestamply.org](https://timestamply.org/). The old [timestamp.decred.org](https://timestamp.decred.org/) still works, too. { _may move to Eco_ }


### Documentation

_[dcrdocs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs) is the source code for Decred [user documentation](https://docs.decred.org/)._

- Multiple updates for command-line apps in [v1.8.0 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1223).


### Bison Relay

_[Bison Relay](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay) is a new social media platform with strong protections against censorship, surveillance, and advertising, powered by Decred Lightning Network._

All work reported below is merged to `master` towards the next release.

GUI and CLI apps:

- Create new group chats [version 1](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/263) by default. This is the latest version that supports multiple admins in one group chat.
- [Persist](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/257) received but not fully processed group chat messages. This helps to show messages in the correct order, especially after app restart.
- Reduced max number of [idle HTTP connections](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/281) from 100 to 2. HTTP connections to the "normal web" are used to fetch DCR/BTC and BTC/USD exchange rates.
- Made server [reconnection loop](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/290) faster.
- Fixed some issues with [key exchanges](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/273) (KX). Improved reporting of completed KX in direct and group chats. Avoid multiple KX attempts with same user when joining multiple group chats. Added automatic KX attempts when sending messages to group chat members, this should fix message delivery issues due to missed KX with target user.

GUI app:

- Added [Address Book](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/256) that lists all known users and group chats. Recent chats list was optimized to hide empty chats and show newer chats on top. Hidden empty chats can be brought back from the address book.
- Added [search and filter](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/264) function to the Address Book page.
- Added ability to [hide non-empty chats](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/264). Hidden chats can be shown again via the address book.
- Create [config directory](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/259) if it is missing.
- Store and load [invoices](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/282) to better track tip status across app restarts.
- Improved [sorting of Feed posts](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/288) to take recent comments into account.
- Improved post [commenting UX](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/291) to better visualize if the user is adding a top-level comment or a reply to another comment.
- Refined [chat list UX](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/292). { _clarify_ }
- Optimized [vertical space](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/293) on inbound and outbound channel pages.
- Updated [Flutter](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/258) dependencies.
- Refactoring. { 259 - snackbar, 270 - snackbar }
- Fixed loading of history for contacts that have [not completed a key exchange](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/257).
- Fixed a bug that could prevent errors from being properly [shown](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/271) on the onboarding page.
- Fixed a bug where the Chats page was not aware of [hidden chats](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/276) and would erroneously show "Funds Needed" or "Invite Needed" pages.
- Fixed [Suggest KX](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/277) action not working properly. This also adds hidden users to the dropdown.
- Fixed possibility to open [multiple file pickers](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/262) in places like creating posts or generating invites.

CLI app:

- Allow to create a new post from an [existing file](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/253) with the `/post new` command.
- Allow to author posts and comments in an [external text editor](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/253) as configured in the `EDITOR` environment variable.
- Allow to [embed images](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/253) in posts and comments by adding `localfilename` directive, which will be replaced with file's contents.
- Allow to [review and confirm comments](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/253) before sending them.
- Added command to [set exchange rates manually](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/272) and reduced log verbosity for failures to fetch rates from dcrdata and Bittrex.
- Fixed [duplicated messages](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/254) in new chat windows.

Stores implementation:

- Added a page to see information about one [order](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/255).
- Allow store [admin](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/260) and [customer](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/283) to add comments to the order, and show them on both admin and customer order pages.

Preparations for mobile app builds:

- Configured the embedded dcrlnd to [not include IP or hostname](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/267) in generated TLS certificates. This is needed to make the Android version compile. { _maybe further explain or group_ }
- Updated [gomobile](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/267) library.
- Fixed [compilation of `golib`](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/267) with gomobile. `golib` is an adapter for the low level Bison Relay code in Go for reuse by the high level GUI code, which is written in Dart and Flutter.
- Moved and adapted some [desktop code](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/267) to a shared location to enable reuse on mobile. { _reword or group_ }
- Made multiple changes specific to [iOS and Android builds](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/267).
- First pass of making views [responsive](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/285) and usable on smaller screens and mobile platforms. A more thorough design implementation will be done in the future once UX specs are finalized.

Developer and internal changes:

- Added script to automate setting the correct [version information](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/274) in 6 files. { _group_ }
- Updated Decred and third party [Go dependencies](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/268). { _also 278; group_ }
- Refactored GitHub [build config](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/280). { _group_ }
- Code [cleanup](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/279). { _group_ }
- Refactored [config parsing](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/289) to use INI sections. { _group_ }

## Governance

{ _Hint: Currently this is a mix of finances and governance. We may add the separate Finances section in the future._ }

In June the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 7,760 DCR worth $110K at June's average rate of $14.25. 4,604 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $66K at same rate.

A [treasury spend tx](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/tx/4734a7e88ecb366d5c3be8510c35e846ff5a117fa92e24a0ad9329ac65b4925f) was approved with 7,456 Yes votes and 52% turnout, and mined on 13 Jun. It had 20 outputs making payments to contractors, ranging from 4 DCR to 1,308 DCR. Most of this DCR was likely paid for April work, at its billing exchange rate of $20.22 the TSpend is worth around $93K.

{ _Other interesting facts/stories about the legacy or new treasury._ }

As of July 9, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 863.788 DCR (13.9 million USD at $16.06).

{ _High-level recap of decision-making activity and most important events._ }

There were 4 proposals published in June, and one from May which finished voting:

- A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/552c87e) to fund development of the Decred.club website with Chinese language content  and grow a community around it for $2,400 was rejected with 28% Yes votes and 26% turnout.

Bittrex US was [allowed](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/14/bankrupt-crypto-exchange-bittrex-us-set-to-allow-withdrawals-starting-thursday/) to re-open customer withdrawals, these would usually be frozen during liquidation but Bittrex argued to allow customers to withdraw their funds and a judge agreed, although stating that this did not make a determination that the customers (still) owned the assets and there may be clawbacks as the liquidation process continues.

The SEC has [sued](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/05/sec-sues-crypto-exchange-binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao/) Binance and CZ in a long-anticipated move which declares a number of the assets Binance lists as securities and alleges that they were allowing US citizens to trade on the platform, even encouraging the whales. The SEC's [complaint](https://downloads.coindesk.com/legal/Binance.pdf) lists 10 crypto tokens with a page or more of explanation about its origins and why the SEC considers it a security. The tokens listed as securities are: SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, and COTI.

In the day or so following the suit being brought by SEC, both Binance ($1.43 Billion) and Coinbase ($1.18 Billion) saw significant net [outflows](https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/06/06/binance-coinbase-net-negative-outflows-billions-sec-lawsuits/) of assets, with customers withdrawing much more than they were depositing, in response to the news.

Some of the consequences of the SEC pursuit are [transfer](https://www.reuters.com/technology/urgent-binance-sec-strike-deal-move-all-us-customer-funds-wallet-keys-back-2023-06-17/) of control of assets to staff of Binance US, such that staff of Binance Holdings no longer have any access to crypto assets or internal systems. This was part of a deal reached to avoid a freezing of all Binance assets in the US, which [threatened](https://www.reuters.com/technology/binanceus-suspends-usd-deposits-pausing-fiat-withdrawal-channels-2023-06-09/) Binance US's ability to process dollar transactions.

There was more bad news for Binance, with the [loss](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/28/binance-eur-banking-partner-to-halt-support-of-the-crypto-exchange-in-september/) of its EUR banking partner after pulling out of [Netherlands](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/16/binance-to-quit-netherlands-after-failing-to-acquire-license/) after failing to acquire a license, giving up on licenses in [UK](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/19/uk-financial-watchdog-cancels-binance-permissions-on-firms-request/) and [Cyprus](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/14/binances-cyprus-unit-under-examination-for-deregistration-as-crypto-service-provider/) and being ordered to [stop](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/23/binance-ordered-to-immediately-halt-offering-crypto-services-in-belgium-by-markets-regulator/) offering crypto services in Belgium.

Binance has [reversed](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-relists-privacy-coins-in-europe) its decision to delist several privacy-oriented crypto-assets for users from some European countries to comply with the new MiCA regulations. After listening to user feedback and from the communities for those projects, they decided they could continue to support them as they have transparent public ledgers.

Binance is also working to [integrate](https://twitter.com/binance/status/1671042638592589826) Bitcoin Lightning Network for deposits and withdrawals.

The SEC also [sued](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-102) Coinbase for operating as an unregistered securities exchange, to which Coinbase has [responded](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/29/sec-has-no-jurisdiction-over-cryptos-on-coinbases-platform-exchange-claims-in-response-to-regulators-lawsuit/) arguing that the SEC has no jurisdiction over the assets on its platform, because Coinbase only hosts secondary markets and does not offer any cryptos for sale directly from their issuer.

The SEC's long running suit against Ripple has brought to light behind the scenes feedback to Bill Hinman's (in)famous speech in which he said that Ether did not look like a security and declared that networks which are "sufficiently decentralized" didn't have to worry about securities law, going on to list some things the SEC would look at in making such a determination. The emails surrounding the speech [reveal](https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1668601225418543109) that Bill ignored concerns from colleagues about some aspects of it, including the freedom with which he was adding new factors and using Ether as a named example, which they cautioned would make it difficult to pursue ETH related securities violations in future.

The "Electric Coin Company" (ECC) has announced (in May) that it is [restructuring](https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/) to serve Zcash in different ways, with a much smaller team (13 staff, 50% are being made redundant) and focused on core specialisms like the transition to Proof of Stake consensus. Many of the functions of the ECC will be transferred to other entities within the ZEC community. 

MakerDAO has [voted](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/01/makerdao-votes-to-ditch-500m-in-paxos-dollar-stablecoin-from-reserve-assets/) to remove the USDP stablecoin provided by Paxos from its reserves, these currently include $500 Million of USDP and that is half of the token's supply.

Payment processor Mastercard has set up a testbed dubbed the "[Multi-Token Network](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/28/mastercard-is-piloting-tokenized-bank-deposits-in-new-uk-testbed/)" (MTN) for tokenizing bank deposits, turning them into digital tokens on blockchains which are programmable like crypto tokens. A beta version of MTN will be available to industry partners in the UK from summer 2023 and they are setting up an innovation spring where selected teams will be given access to MTN so they can develop use cases. Mastercard plans to experiment with stablecoins and CBDCs on MTN also.

Watchers of CRV [noted](https://twitter.com/scott_lew_is/status/1669057317684359170) on twitter that over 30% of its circulating supply had been deposited as collatoral for loans in the AAVE protocol by one user, the founder, prompting concern that if the position were liquidated the market would be flooded with CRV and the Aave protocol would end up with a lot of bad debt. The CRV price did decline further but the borrower in question [repaid](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/15/wallet-linked-to-curve-founder-repays-13m-to-aave-amid-crv-token-decline/) some of the debt and decreased the liquidation risk. 

Many users of Atomic Wallet had their assets [stolen](https://decrypt.co/143362/atomic-wallet-attack-exploit-investigation) in an apparent hack on June 3, with early estimates of $35 million and [later](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1668778031790587905) $100 million of the losses incurred by users. However, it remains unclear what the cause of the hack was, and a blog post from the wallet's developers on June 22 left a lot of [unanswered](https://cointelegraph.com/news/atomic-wallet-hack-statement-exploit-unanswered-questions) questions - they offered four possibilities for how users funds were stolen but weren't sure which one was the real cause. They suggested that all of the thefts occurred on June 3, but they are just going from user testimony and reports the same as the community researchers who have been looking into it and giving more timely updates.

Users of the web 3 betting platform Polymarket have drawn [attention](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/titanic-submarine-online-gambling-cryptocurrency-b2363328.html) for [gambling](https://protos.com/crypto-is-betting-on-the-missing-titan-sub-and-its-looking-bearish/) on the outcome of the lost Titan submersible, with several hundred thousand dollars worth of cryptocurrency being wagered, making it the site's most active market at the time. The Polymarket [event](https://polymarket.com/event/will-the-missing-submarine-be-found-by-june-23) betting on whether the Titan submersible would be found by June 23 went to dispute resolution after resolving to "Yes" when pieces of the submarine were indeed found, but several [stories](https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/gamblers-bet-titan-sub/) about the event reference people making money from "betting that the Titan submersible would not be found". It has not been possible to locate the dispute resolution outcome on Polymarket itself.

While the SEC has been going after many established crypto exchanges for alleged securities violations, a new player has [emerged](https://decrypt.co/144833/prometheum-sec-poster-child-crypto-compliance), Prometheum, which appears to be on a fast track to getting the sorts of approval that the likes of Coinbase have been trying to obtain for years. The Prometheum co-CEO turned up on Capitol Hill to testify before Congress and what he said was widely seen as parroting the SEC's position, raising questions about where this new unknown entrant was coming from and why they were getting along so well with the SEC. The company claims to have been working on its regulatory approvals for years but has remained largely unknown because its "crawl-walk-run-approach" means it doesn't actually offer any BTC or ETH trading yet. It has been [suggested](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1669143092274888704) that hiring insiders from FINRA and the SEC is the key to why Prometheum got approved and then started showing up to hearings with pro-SEC talking points.

One of the two Chinese entities with links to and an ownership stake in Prometheum is Wanxiang, an organisation which [lists](https://decrypt.co/145654/ethereum-founder-vitalik-buterin-prometheum-ties) Vitalik Buterin as one of its co-founders. Vitalik's relationship to Wanxiang dates back to Ethereum's early days in 2015 when then-CEO made an investment of $500,000 in ETH, which helped to cover some developers' salaries.

There is a long-running court [battle](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/08/consensys-faces-shareholder-vote-over-controversial-transfer-of-company-assets/) between Consensys, the Ethereum development organisation led by Joe Lubin, and employees of its original Swiss entity (Consensys AG). The dispute is about a transfer of assets (Consensys owns several major Ethereum infrastructure providers like Infura) in 2020 to a new US based entity which JP Morgan invested in - the employees of Consensys AG held equity in the company, and claim that the assets were given an absurdly low valuation ($47 million) so that they would receive very little of the money coming from JP Morgan (indirectly) for those assets. This month, Consensys held a shareholder vote to retroactively approve the transfer - something they were instructed to do by a Swiss court, which will allow the employees to proceed with the next step of their multi-year legal proceedings.

The IMF has decided that banning crypto "[may not be effective ](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/06/22/cf-interest-in-cb-digital-currencies-picks-up-in-latam-the-caribbean-while-crypto-use-varies)in the long run", after [previously](https://www.reuters.com/world/imf-flags-debt-disagreements-says-banning-crypto-should-not-be-off-table-2023-02-25/) suggesting this as an option all the way back in Feb 2023. They now suggest addressing demand for digital payments in other ways to decrease demand for crypto, but not to ban it because that stops the country from gaining any benefits.

The SEC has [reduced](https://decrypt.co/140181/sec-lbry-44-million-burden-reduced-111k-penalty) the financial penalty imposed on LBRY from $44 Million to $111,000 - but rather than a change of heart this reflects acknowledgement that the entity is now defunct and being wound down, not capable of paying millions of dollars in fines. The marathon case against LBRY by the SEC dragged on for years until it was [resolved](https://decrypt.co/113754/lbry-loses-sec-case-dangerous-precedent-crypto) in November 2022 with a loss for LBRY and the judge establishing precedents that cast a wide net in terms of securities violations. LBRY sold tokens before their network was operational, and so the courts decided that any sale of LBRY tokens by the organisation would constitute an illegal securities offering, even for a $5 transaction to tip some video creators - a primary intended purpose of LBRY tokens.

The Israeli government has [seized](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/28/israel-seizes-millions-in-crypto-from-iranian-military-and-hezbollah-report/) $1.7 million in crypto from wallets linked to the Iranian military and the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon. Chainalysis assisted in tracking the USDT on the Tron network to 40 different addresses, which were frozen on the authority of the Defence Minister. In May Israel [reported](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/05/israel-has-seized-190-binance-accounts-with-alleged-terrorist-ties-since-2021-reuters/) the freezing of 190 Binance accounts associated with Hamas and Daesh since 2021.

The European Commission has [published](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/28/eu-publishes-digital-euro-bill-featuring-privacy-controls-offline-guarantee/) its legislative plans to underpin a digital Euro, identifying some advantages like facilitating transactions between people at higher data protection standards than banks, and making free access to payments available everywhere including remote locations. While the Commission wants a privacy-preserving digital Euro it is down to the European Central Bank to issue one, and there remains much opposition to the idea within banking circles. The proposals have been [criticised](https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/preliminary-assessment-of-digital-euro/) as being significantly more prone to surveillance than cash.
