## DCRDEX v0.6.1 Release

{ summary, links to get it, also on Umbrel https://github.com/decred/umbrel-app-store }


## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover its most notable dev work._
- _For each project, the order of reporting is "OLDEST FIRST", or "most released first": changes released to end users, merged to master, in progress (work started), discussions and future plans._
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

}


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Changes merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Cleaned up [several functions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3114) by [removing error states](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3110) which no longer occur.
- [Last August](202208.md#dcrd), in order to combat ASIC attacks on the testnet and ensure CPUs will always be able to mine new testnet blocks, the [testnet was updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2978) so that the testnet mining difficulty is throttled by a maximum value. This month, the mining template generator and CPU miner were updated to [remove the old testnet logic](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/c6e53c9ef0926f172a637a6552b744cbd6445537) that no longer applies, since all new testnet blocks enforce difficulty throttling.
- [Removed a deprecated internal method](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3113) which listed subscribed clients waiting for blockchain updates. Since this method was internal, it never needed to be shared outside of dcrd.
- [A bug was discovered via dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/1963) where the total coin supply calculation returned from the dcrd RPC server did not include the new TreasuryBases—the part of each block's reward that flows into the new decentralized treasury. The total coin supply calculation [has now been updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3112), which also included an update to the database. It should be noted that this bug was only a minor error with the RPC coin supply calculation, and did not affect consensus in any way.

In progress:

- Implementing [DCP-11](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3115) PoW hash consensus vote.


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

Changes ready for the next v1.7.x release:

- Respect [proxy config](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commit/7fbdd7fba71525149bf7a98dc7f8033f34a1e108) for SPV and P2P seeder connections. This is to prevent leaking internal network details.

Changes merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Use the latest versions of several [dcrd modules](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2234) and a few third party [dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2236)
- Allow the wallet to [follow the DCP-12 hard fork](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2232) if it is approved and activated.
- Remove several [deprecated internal methods](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2235), namely those made obsolete by the consensus changes [DCP-9](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0009/dcp-0009.mediawiki) (Automatic Ticket Revocations) and [DCP-10](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0010/dcp-0010.mediawiki) (Change PoW/PoS Subsidy Split to 10/80).


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

In progress:

- [Ledger support](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/3865): adding [low-level functions](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3869) and [UI views](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3874).
- Since staking is not available for any hardware wallets, staking views will be [removed](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3870) to avoid confusion.
- Added [Ledger icon](https://github.com/decred/pi-ui/pull/479) to the pi-ui shared library.

Other:

- Decrediton has been [added](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/pull/106493) to the [winget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Package_Manager) package repository. Windows user can now [install](https://matrix.to/#/!zefvTnlxYHPKvJMThI:decred.org/$25tEa195uFjzuxC0J9ecm7X8NRGUAhcrUqNvuUKfHqM?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=planetdecred.org) it with `winget install Decred.Decrediton`.


### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software used by Voting Service Providers. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

- Added [automatic VSP fee payment](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/382) from dcrwallet's internal package to vspd's public `client` package. This allows reuse of client-side VSP code by other software and is needed for [DCR staking](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2290) integration in DCRDEX.


### Lightning Network

_[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant and low-cost transactions._

- Added support for [custom connection](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/182) for dcrwallet. It allows LN code to configure dcrwallet to connect to SPV peers using a proxy server.


### cspp

_[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp) is a server for coordinating coin mixes using the CoinShuffle++ protocol. It is non-custodial, i.e. never holds any funds. CSPP is part of StakeShuffle, Decreds privacy system._

- Prevent [duplicate inputs](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/92) earlier in the mixing process. Before this fix double spends would trigger an error when sending the mix transaction, it would fail a mixing session and avoid blame assignment.
- Improved [logigng](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/93) of mixing sessions to always capture session ID, run number, and denomination value of mixed outputs.
- Prevent CoinJoin transactions from [exceeding mempool size limits](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/94). This may exclude some peers from a mix, if that happens the server will attempt to pair them in the next mixing epoch. A check has been added to retry the session if the number of peers [drops below the minimum](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/95) setting.


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

Changes included in v0.6.1 release: { _maybe visually group changes by asset_ }

- Set high enough [Zcash transaction fee rate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2336). DEX calculates fees based on transaction size, but Zcash is an exception as it currently uses a standard fee of 1,000 zats or 0.00001 ZEC per transaction, regardless of size. This will change when [ZIP 317](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0317) activates, resulting in higher fees. To ensure DEX transactions are always relayed and mined, this change bumps fees to be around 0.0002-0.0003 ZEC. A hard-coded fee rate of 84 zats/byte is used as a workaround for Zcash not having an easy way to estimate fees. { _follow-up backport in f7fb3b_ }
- [DigiByte](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2323) trading support with full node wallets.
- Added [block explorer](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2340) links to ZEC transactions.
- Added compile time config for the [interval](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2339) at which DEX server polls for new blocks of Bitcoin-like assets. The original 1-second poll interval is too fast for remote nodes.
- Fixed failure to reconfigure a disconnected Bitcoin-like wallet in certain circumstances. { 2171ec }
- Fixed Bitcoin-like wallets always requiring a restart and not having a chance for live reconfiguration. { 2dc4dd }
- Fixed full restart not being triggered in some scenarios of changing RPC connection config. { e9f3714 }
- Fixed incorrect [transaction ID](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2342) shown when sending ZEC.
- Fixed several issues with [bonds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2343) for ZEC and non-SegWit assets.
- Backported ~22 [fixes and improvements](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2323) made in `master` before May.

All other changes below are merged in `master` towards future releases.

Client:

- Added expected [refund time](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2042) to the Matches card. Previously it could show just "<Pending>" for hours.
- Simplifed wallet [enable/disable logic](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2324). Disabling chain's primary asset wallet will also disable all token wallets for that chain. Enabling a token wallet will also enable chain's primary asset wallet.
- Optimized [request handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2350) by minimizing expensive calls to load user information.
- Restored [colored logging](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2350) of HTTP requests to stdout.
- Utilize external [fee rate sources](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2354) in SPV mode. Before this change it was possible to pay unreasonably high fee when sending from an SPV wallet.
- Removed requirement to enter a [password when canceling an order](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2374).

Bitcoin:

- Fixed [issues](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2326): simnet wallet could connect to mainnet, Bitcoin-like wallets always require a restart, reconfiguring a disconnected wallet could fail in certain circumstances.

Ethereum:

- Made [token approvals](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2349) a separate manual step instead of an automatic part of the first swap. In order to trade tokens the swap contract must be approved to handle tokens on behalf of the user. Making it a manual action allows users to be aware of what is happening and not be surprised by the high fee of their first swap. An approval can be revoked in wallet settings.

Firo:

- Added [full node wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2270) support for [Firo](https://firo.org/) (formerly known as Zcoin).
- Up next is support for Firo [light wallets](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2346) based on Electrum. { _follow-up fixes: 2353, 2365_ }

App packaging:

- Introduced a new executable `dexc-desktop` that wraps the DEX web app in a WebView component to look like a [desktop app](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1957). The app will keep running in the background if there are active orders (can be force-closed using the `--kill` switch on the command line).
- Filter out [unavailable assets](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2360). { _may group, small fix_ }
- Added script to build [Debian packages](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/ca5b1d8914b8d84bdfa4cbe28a6c97f5a20c18c4).

Developer and internal changes:

- Updated [npm dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2321).
- Moved the [market making](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2320) bot logic out of the `Core` package into its [own package](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/tree/ca5b1d8914b8d84bdfa4cbe28a6c97f5a20c18c4/client/mm). This is needed to improve architecture and add more bot strategies in the future.
- Enabled the [makezero](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2344) linter to detect more bugs in memory allocation. { _may group_ }
- Switched builds and tests from using [Node.js](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2341) v16 and v18 to v18 and v20. Node v16 will reach end-of-life in September 2023. { _may group_ }
- Refactoring { 2364 }
- Changed chain tip and peer tracking goroutines to [shutdown](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2369) more cleanly.

_Image: DEX'es swap contract requires a one-time approval to swap your tokens._


### dcrdata

_[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata) is an explorer for Decred blockchain and off-chain data like Politeia proposals, markets, and more._

- Fixed numbers being slightly off on the [address balance charts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1962) due to not filtering out sidechain and invalid outputs.


### Bison Relay

_[Bison Relay](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay) is a new social media platform with strong protections against censorship, surveillance, and advertising, powered by Decred Lightning Network._

GUI and CLI apps:

- Implemented initial version of the [Pages](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/224) feature. Pages allow to browse static content from a remote user. Only [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) pages are supported. Pages can link to other users' pages using `br://` links. Limitations of the first iteration are listed in the [pull request](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/224). Pages is a big feature that will need rounds of improvements in response to user feedback.
- Improved [tip retry](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/236) strategy. Instead of making multiple parallel attempts at paying tips for one user, only a single one is tried at a time. This should help avoid problems with tip payments failing due to nodes with low capacity. Also tip attempts failed for having no LN route will be retried (this error may be temporary). CLI app can list running tip user attempts with the new `/runningtips` command.
- Added ability to connect the embedded dcrlnd through the configured proxy server (such as Tor) to both the [CLI app](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/235) and the [GUI app](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/239). New `circuitlimit` config parameter allows to limit the number of [open connections](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/234) when using proxy. { _follow-up in 238_ }
- Added [handshake feature](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/246) that allows clients to test that their encryption ratchets are still working.
- Implemented [persistent chat history](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/230) that remembers last 500 messages and shows them after restarting the app. All chats are stored in log files but accessing history from the app itself is better UX and has been a frequent feature request. The plan is to eventually add on-demand loading of history as the user scrolls back in time. { _DMs only or GCs too?_ }
- Fixed possible [broken ratchets](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/248) when two users simultaneously attempt to exchange keys with each other. This could happen when two users are added to two different group chats where the other user already exists, which initiates two key exchanges at the same time.

GUI app:

- Added [context menu](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/issues/216) to individual chats and group chats.
- Added a floating button to [jumpt to recent messages](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/231). { _follow-up: 247_ }
- Restricted size of [embedded images](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/244) shown in chats and posts. Bigger image is shown if clicked. This fixes issues with scrolling and different image sizes.
- Fixed chat menu [overflow](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/227) if window height is too small. { _may group_ }
- Fixed some issues with [text selection](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/226), added height limit to code blocks and made them scrollable. Two Flutter widgets have been forked and patched to workaround the issues, but double click (select word) and triple click (select paragraph) still don't work.
- Fixed [scrollbar issues](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/249) on LN management views.
- Refactored [snackbar internals](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/issues/152) to avoid possible errors when related components get hidden. Snackbar is a popup bar that briefly shows notifications. { _group_ }

CLI app:

- Enabled brclient to delegate Pages and Store requests to [another program](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/224) via the [clientrpc API](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/tree/master/clientrpc), and forward its responses back to requesting BR users. This flexibility will enable useful features in the future.
- Enabled brclient to delegate requests to a HTTP or HTTPS [website](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/224). This allows BR users to access HTTP/HTTPS resources through another BR user who acts as a proxy.
- Sort posts by [most recent activity](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/243). Also unread posts will be highlighted with a different color.
- Allow to use the `/closechannel` command with a [short prefix](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/252) of the channel ID (which is 64 characters long).

Stores:

- Implemented merchant-side foundations for [simple Stores](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/224). Unlike Pages, Stores are dynamic resources that can present product items for sale. Store has a front page and individual product pages that are generated from local files. Store is reloaded automatically if any of its files changes. BR client running the store can serve product pages, maintain the shopping cart, handle order placement, and create invoices. Prices will be shown in USD but paid in DCR. Exchange rate is sourced from [dcrdata](https://explorer.dcrdata.org). Placed order is valid for 60 minutes when the DCR amount does not change. CLI app only supports on-chain payments. This iteration only adds merchant-side logic, customer-side browsing is not available yet. { _is order placement implemented?_ } { _follow-ups: 240 (clear cart)_ }
- Implemented [simple forms](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/241). Forms can be viewed, filled and submitted by store customers to add items to the shopping cart or to place an order.
- Added [shipping details](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/250) to orders. Some products may require to fill shipping info.

Other:

- Added end-to-end [performance tests](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/245).

{ _Hints (all optional):_

_1. Besides dramatic "epic fails", try to also report "epic wins" in areas relevant to Decred. Balance is good and we can learn from both._

_2. Order the stories as follows:_

- _Crypto L1 tech: PoW, ASIC resistance, full nodes, network security, etc._
- _Crypto L2+ tech: "Smart" contracts, DEX projects_
- _Crypto governance, finances, transparency, funding, chain forks, community splits_
- _Relevant exchanges and websites_
- _Regulations, privacy, security_
- _Fun stuff_
