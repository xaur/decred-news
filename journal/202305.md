## { Some Announcement }

{ _Add individual sections for high-impact announcements, such as consensus votes, software releases, milestones, major bugs, etc._ }


## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover its most notable dev work._
- _For each project, the order of reporting is "OLDEST FIRST", or "most released first": changes released to end users, merged to master, in progress (work started), discussions and future plans._
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

}


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Changes merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Cleaned up [several functions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3114) by [removing error states](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3110) which no longer occur.
- [Last August](202208.md#dcrd), in order to combat ASIC attacks on the testnet and ensure CPUs will always be able to mine new testnet blocks, the [testnet was updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2978) so that the testnet mining difficulty is throttled by a maximum value. This month, the mining template generator and CPU miner were updated to [remove the old testnet logic](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/c6e53c9ef0926f172a637a6552b744cbd6445537) that no longer applies, since all new testnet blocks enforce difficulty throttling.
- [Removed a deprecated internal method](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3113) which listed subscribed clients waiting for blockchain updates. Since this method was internal, it never needed to be shared outside of dcrd.
- [A bug was discovered via dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/1963) where the total coin supply calculation returned from the dcrd RPC server did not include the new TreasuryBases—the part of each block's reward that flows into the new decentralized treasury. The total coin supply calculation [has now been updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3112), which also included an update to the database. It should be noted that this bug was only a minor error with the RPC coin supply calculation, and did not affect consensus in any way.

In progress:

- Implement [DCP-11](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3115) PoW hash consensus vote

{ _image candidates: 3115 (ASERT algo charts)_ }
{ I don't think we need an image yet since this wasn't merged in May.}

### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

Changes ready for the next v1.7.x release:

- Respect [proxy config](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commit/7fbdd7fba71525149bf7a98dc7f8033f34a1e108) for SPV and P2P seeder connections. This is to prevent leaking internal network details.

Changes merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Use the latest versions of several [dcrd modules](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2234) and a few third party [dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2236)
- Allow the wallet to [follow the DCP-12 hard fork](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2232) if it is approved and activated.
- Remove several [deprecated internal methods](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2235), namely those made obsolete by the consensus changes [DCP-9](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0009/dcp-0009.mediawiki) (Automatic Ticket Revocations) and [DCP-10](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0010/dcp-0010.mediawiki) (Change PoW/PoS Subsidy Split to 10/80).

}

Changes included in v0.6.1 release: { _maybe visually group changes by asset_ }

- Set high enough [Zcash transaction fee rate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2336). DEX calculates fees based on transaction size, but Zcash is an exception as it currently uses a standard fee of 1,000 zats or 0.00001 ZEC per transaction, regardless of size. This will change when [ZIP 317](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0317) activates, resulting in higher fees. To ensure DEX transactions are always relayed and mined, this change bumps fees to be around 0.0002-0.0003 ZEC. A hard-coded fee rate of 84 zats/byte is used as a workaround for Zcash not having an easy way to estimate fees. { _follow-up backport in f7fb3b_ }
- [DigiByte](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2323) trading support with full node wallets.
- Added [block explorer](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2340) links to ZEC transactions.
- Added compile time config for the [interval](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2339) at which DEX server polls for new blocks of Bitcoin-like assets. The original 1-second poll interval is too fast for remote nodes.
- Fixed failure to reconfigure a disconnected Bitcoin-like wallet in certain circumstances. { 2171ec }
- Fixed Bitcoin-like wallets always requiring a restart and not having a chance for live reconfiguration. { 2dc4dd }
- Fixed full restart not being triggered in some scenarios of changing RPC connection config. { e9f3714 }
- Fixed incorrect [transaction ID](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2342) shown when sending ZEC.
- Fixed several issues with [bonds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2343) for ZEC and non-SegWit assets.
- Backported ~22 [fixes and improvements](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2323) made in `master` before May.

All other changes below are merged in `master` towards future releases.

Client:

- Added expected [refund time](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2042) to the Matches card. Previously it could show just "<Pending>" for hours.
- Simplifed wallet [enable/disable logic](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2324). Disabling chain's primary asset wallet will also disable all token wallets for that chain. Enabling a token wallet will also enable chain's primary asset wallet.
- Optimized [request handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2350) by minimizing expensive calls to load user information.
- Restored [colored logging](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2350) of HTTP requests to stdout.
- Utilize external [fee rate sources](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2354) in SPV mode. Before this change it was possible to pay unreasonably high fee when sending from an SPV wallet.
- Removed requirement to enter a [password when canceling an order](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2374).

Bitcoin:

- Fixed [issues](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2326): simnet wallet could connect to mainnet, Bitcoin-like wallets always require a restart, reconfiguring a disconnected wallet could fail in certain circumstances.

Ethereum:

- Made [token approvals](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2349) a separate manual step instead of an automatic part of the first swap. In order to trade tokens the swap contract must be approved to handle tokens on behalf of the user. Making it a manual action allows users to be aware of what is happening and not be surprised by the high fee of their first swap. An approval can be revoked in wallet settings.

Firo:

- Added [full node wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2270) support for [Firo](https://firo.org/) (formerly known as Zcoin).
- Up next is support for Firo [light wallets](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2346) based on Electrum. { _follow-up fixes: 2353, 2365_ }

App packaging:

- Introduced a new executable `dexc-desktop` that wraps the DEX web app in a WebView component to look like a [desktop app](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1957). The app will keep running in the background if there are active orders (can be force-closed using the `--kill` switch on the command line).
- Filter out [unavailable assets](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2360). { _may group, small fix_ }
- Added script to build [Debian packages](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/ca5b1d8914b8d84bdfa4cbe28a6c97f5a20c18c4).

Developer and internal changes:

- Updated [npm dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2321).
- Moved the [market making](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2320) bot logic out of the `Core` package into its [own package](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/tree/ca5b1d8914b8d84bdfa4cbe28a6c97f5a20c18c4/client/mm). This is needed to improve architecture and add more bot strategies in the future.
- Enabled the [makezero](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2344) linter to detect more bugs in memory allocation. { _may group_ }
- Switched builds and tests from using [Node.js](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2341) v16 and v18 to v18 and v20. Node v16 will reach end-of-life in September 2023. { _may group_ }
- Refactoring { 2364 }
- Changed chain tip and peer tracking goroutines to [shutdown](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2369) more cleanly.

## Network

{

- _Hint: "Network" tracks key "health" metrics of the fundamental infrastructure._
- _Hint: `n`, `n.n`, and `n.nn` tell how many decimals to keep, e.g. 100, 16.5, 8.63_

}

**Hashrate**: May's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of {} Ph/s hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

{ _Hint: Fallback links for pool distribution: https://poolbay.io/crypto/54/decred , https://dcrstats.com/pow ._ }

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between {n}-{n} DCR.

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, meaning that {n.n}-{n.n}% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) in Proof of Stake.

{ _Add a recap of ticket price action if it was interesting._ }

**VSP**: The [{} listed VSPs](https://decred.org/vsp/) collectively managed ~{n} (+{n}) live tickets, which was {n.n}% of the ticket pool (+{n.n}%) as of {date}.

{ _Optional: mention biggest gainers_ }

**Nodes**: [Decred Mapper](https://nodes.jholdstock.uk/user_agents) observed between {} and {} dcrd nodes throughout the month. Versions of {} nodes seen on {date}: v{} - {n}%, ...

{ _Optional_ } The share of [mixed coins](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&zoom=jz3q237o-la8vk000&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true-true-true) varied between {n.n}-{n.n}%. Daily [mixed volume](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=privacy-participation&bin=day&axis=time) varied between {n}-{n}K DCR.

Decred's [Lightning Network](https://ln-map.jholdstock.uk/) explorer has seen {} nodes (+{}), {} channels (+{}) with a total capacity of {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}), as of {date}. These stats are different for each node. For example, @karamble's node reported {} nodes (+{}), {} channels (+{}) and {} DCR (+{}) capacity on same day {}.

{ _Compare DCR and LTC LN's on same day via https://1ml.com/litecoin/ ._ }

{ _Add any interesting analysis or events in the network._ }


## Ecosystem

{ _Hint: "Ecosystem" is about new units of infrastructure or updates from existing: VSPs, exchanges, wallets, OTC desks, payment processors, investors. It is more about user-facing services, businesses, and wider adoption, while Network is more about the backbone. Use bullets or paragraphs, whatever looks best._

{ _Hints (all optional):_

_1. Besides dramatic "epic fails", try to also report "epic wins" in areas relevant to Decred. Balance is good and we can learn from both._

_2. Order the stories as follows:_

- _Crypto L1 tech: PoW, ASIC resistance, full nodes, network security, etc._
- _Crypto L2+ tech: "Smart" contracts, DEX projects_
- _Crypto governance, finances, transparency, funding, chain forks, community splits_
- _Relevant exchanges and websites_
- _Regulations, privacy, security_
- _Fun stuff_
