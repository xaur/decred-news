## { Some Announcement }

{ _Add individual sections for high-impact announcements, such as consensus votes, software releases, milestones, major bugs, etc._ }


## DCRDEX v0.6.1 Release

{ summary, links to get it, also on Umbrel https://github.com/decred/umbrel-app-store }


## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Changes merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Cleaned up [several functions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3114) by [removing error states](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3110) which no longer occur.
- [Last August](202208.md#dcrd), in order to combat ASIC attacks on the testnet and ensure CPUs will always be able to mine new testnet blocks, the [testnet was updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2978) so that the testnet mining difficulty is throttled by a maximum value. This month, the mining template generator and CPU miner were updated to [remove the old testnet logic](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/c6e53c9ef0926f172a637a6552b744cbd6445537) that no longer applies, since all new testnet blocks enforce difficulty throttling.
- [Removed a deprecated internal method](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3113) which listed subscribed clients waiting for blockchain updates. Since this method was internal, it never needed to be shared outside of dcrd.
- [A bug was discovered via dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/1963) where the total coin supply calculation returned from the dcrd RPC server did not include the new `TreasuryBases` - the part of each block's reward that flows into the new decentralized treasury. The total coin supply calculation [has now been updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3112), which also included an update to the database. It should be noted that this bug was only a minor error with the RPC coin supply calculation, and did not affect consensus in any way.

In progress:

- Implementing [DCP-11](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3115) PoW hash consensus vote.


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

Changes ready for the next v1.7.x release:

- Respect [proxy config](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commit/7fbdd7fba71525149bf7a98dc7f8033f34a1e108) for SPV and P2P seeder connections. This is to prevent leaking internal network details.

Changes merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Use the latest versions of several [dcrd modules](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2234) and a few third party [dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2236).
- Allow the wallet to [follow the DCP-12 hard fork](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2232) if it is approved and activated.
- Remove several [deprecated internal methods](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2235), namely those made obsolete by the consensus changes [DCP-9](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0009/dcp-0009.mediawiki) (Automatic Ticket Revocations) and [DCP-10](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0010/dcp-0010.mediawiki) (Change PoW/PoS Subsidy Split to 10/80).


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

In progress:

- [Ledger support](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/3865): adding [low-level functions](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3869) and [UI views](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3874).
- Since staking is not currently possible with any hardware wallets, staking views will be [removed](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3870) to avoid confusion.
- Added [Ledger icon](https://github.com/decred/pi-ui/pull/479) to the pi-ui shared library.

Other:

- Decrediton has been [added](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/pull/106493) to the [winget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Package_Manager) package repository. Windows user can now [install](https://matrix.to/#/!zefvTnlxYHPKvJMThI:decred.org/$25tEa195uFjzuxC0J9ecm7X8NRGUAhcrUqNvuUKfHqM?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=planetdecred.org) it with `winget install Decred.Decrediton`.


### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software used by Voting Service Providers. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

- Added [automatic VSP fee payment](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/382) from dcrwallet's internal package to vspd's public `client` package. This allows reuse of client-side VSP code by other software and is needed for [DCR staking](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2290) integration in DCRDEX.


### Lightning Network

_[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant and low-cost transactions._

- Added support for [custom connection](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/182) for dcrwallet. It allows LN code to configure dcrwallet to connect to SPV peers using a proxy server.


### cspp

_[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp) is a server for coordinating coin mixes using the CoinShuffle++ protocol. It is non-custodial, i.e. never holds any funds. CSPP is part of StakeShuffle, Decreds privacy system._

- Prevent [duplicate inputs](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/92) earlier in the mixing process. Before this fix double spends would trigger an error when sending the mix transaction, it could fail a mixing session and avoid blame assignment.
- Improved [logging](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/93) of mixing sessions to always capture session ID, run number, and denomination value of mixed outputs.
- Prevent CoinJoin transactions from [exceeding mempool size limits](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/94). This may exclude some peers from a mix, if that happens the server will attempt to pair them in the next mixing epoch. A check has been added to retry the session if the number of peers [drops below the minimum](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/95) setting.


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

Changes included in v0.6.1 release: { _maybe visually group changes by asset_ }

- Set high enough [Zcash transaction fee rate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2336). DEX calculates fees based on transaction size, but Zcash is an exception as it currently uses a standard fee of 1,000 zats or 0.00001 ZEC per transaction, regardless of size. This will change when [ZIP 317](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0317) activates, resulting in higher fees. To ensure DEX transactions are always relayed and mined, this change bumps fees to be around 0.0002-0.0003 ZEC. A hard-coded fee rate of 84 zats/byte is used as a workaround for Zcash not having an easy way to estimate fees. { _follow-up backport in f7fb3b_ }
- [DigiByte](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2323) trading support with full node wallets.
- Added [block explorer](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2340) links to ZEC transactions.
- Added compile time config for the [interval](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2339) at which DEX server polls for new blocks of Bitcoin-like assets. The original 1-second poll interval is too fast for remote nodes.
- Fixed failure to reconfigure a disconnected Bitcoin-like wallet in certain circumstances. { 2171ec }
- Fixed Bitcoin-like wallets always requiring a restart and not having a chance for live reconfiguration. { 2dc4dd }
- Fixed full restart not being triggered in some scenarios of changing RPC connection config. { e9f3714 }
- Fixed incorrect [transaction ID](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2342) shown when sending ZEC.
- Fixed several issues with [bonds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2343) for ZEC and non-SegWit assets.
- Backported ~22 [fixes and improvements](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2323) made in `master` before May.

All other changes below are merged in `master` towards future releases.

Client:

- Added expected [refund time](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2042) to the Matches card. Previously it could show just "<Pending>" for hours.
- Simplifed wallet [enable/disable logic](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2324). Disabling chain's primary asset wallet will also disable all token wallets for that chain. Enabling a token wallet will also enable chain's primary asset wallet.
- Optimized [request handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2350) by minimizing expensive calls to load user information.
- Restored [colored logging](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2350) of HTTP requests to stdout.
- Utilize external [fee rate sources](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2354) in SPV mode. Before this change it was possible to pay unreasonably high fee when sending from an SPV wallet.
- Removed requirement to enter a [password when canceling an order](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2374).

Bitcoin:

- Fixed [issues](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2326): simnet wallet could connect to mainnet, Bitcoin-like wallets always require a restart, reconfiguring a disconnected wallet could fail in certain circumstances.

Ethereum:

- Made [token approvals](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2349) a separate manual step instead of an automatic part of the first swap. In order to trade tokens the swap contract must be approved to handle tokens on behalf of the user. Making it a manual action allows users to be aware of what is happening and not be surprised by the high fee of their first swap. An approval can be revoked in wallet settings.

Firo:

- Added [full node wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2270) support for [Firo](https://firo.org/) (formerly known as Zcoin).
- Up next is support for Firo [light wallets](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2346) based on Electrum. { _follow-up fixes: 2353, 2365_ }

App packaging:

- Introduced a new executable `dexc-desktop` that wraps the DEX web app in a WebView component to look like a [desktop app](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1957). The app will keep running in the background if there are active orders (can be force-closed using the `--kill` switch on the command line).
- Filter out [unavailable assets](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2360). { _may group, small fix_ }
- Added script to build [Debian packages](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/ca5b1d8914b8d84bdfa4cbe28a6c97f5a20c18c4).

Developer and internal changes:

- Updated [npm dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2321).
- Moved the [market making](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2320) bot logic out of the `Core` package into its [own package](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/tree/ca5b1d8914b8d84bdfa4cbe28a6c97f5a20c18c4/client/mm). This is needed to improve architecture and add more bot strategies in the future.
- Enabled the [makezero](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2344) linter to detect more bugs in memory allocation. { _may group_ }
- Switched builds and tests from using [Node.js](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2341) v16 and v18 to v18 and v20. Node v16 will reach end-of-life in September 2023. { _may group_ }
- Refactoring { 2364 }
- Changed chain tip and peer tracking goroutines to [shutdown](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2369) more cleanly.

### dcrdata

_[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata) is an explorer for Decred blockchain and off-chain data like Politeia proposals, markets, and more._

- Fixed numbers being slightly off on the [address balance charts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1962) due to not filtering out sidechain and invalid outputs.


### Bison Relay

_[Bison Relay](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay) is a new social media platform with strong protections against censorship, surveillance, and advertising, powered by Decred Lightning Network._

GUI and CLI apps:

- Implemented initial version of the [Pages](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/224) feature. Pages allow to browse static content from a remote user. Only [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) pages are supported. Pages can link to other users' pages using `br://` links. Limitations of the first iteration are listed in the [pull request](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/224). Pages is a big feature that will need rounds of improvements in response to user feedback.
- Improved [tip retry](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/236) strategy. Instead of making multiple parallel attempts at paying tips for one user, only a single one is tried at a time. This should help avoid problems with tip payments failing due to nodes with low capacity. Also tip attempts failed for having no LN route will be retried (this error may be temporary). CLI app can list running tip user attempts with the new `/runningtips` command.
- Added ability to connect the embedded dcrlnd through the configured proxy server (such as Tor) to both the [CLI app](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/235) and the [GUI app](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/239). New `circuitlimit` config parameter allows to limit the number of [open connections](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/234) when using proxy. { _follow-up in 238_ }
- Added [handshake feature](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/246) that allows clients to test that their encryption ratchets are still working.
- Implemented [persistent chat history](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/230) that remembers last 500 messages and shows them after restarting the app. All chats are stored in log files but accessing history from the app itself is better UX and has been a frequent feature request. The plan is to eventually add on-demand loading of history as the user scrolls back in time.
- Fixed possible [broken ratchets](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/248) when two users simultaneously attempt to exchange keys with each other. This could happen when two users are added to two different group chats where the other user already exists, which initiates two key exchanges at the same time.

GUI app:

- Added [context menu](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/issues/216) to individual chats and group chats.
- Added a floating button to [jumpt to recent messages](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/231). { _follow-up: 247_ }
- Restricted size of [embedded images](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/244) shown in chats and posts. Bigger image is shown if clicked. This fixes issues with scrolling and different image sizes.
- Fixed chat menu [overflow](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/227) if window height is too small. { _may group_ }
- Fixed some issues with [text selection](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/226), added height limit to code blocks and made them scrollable. Two Flutter widgets have been forked and patched to workaround the issues, but double click (select word) and triple click (select paragraph) still don't work.
- Fixed [scrollbar issues](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/249) on LN management views.
- Refactored [snackbar internals](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/issues/152) to avoid possible errors when related components get hidden. Snackbar is a popup bar that briefly shows notifications. { _group_ }

CLI app:

- Enabled brclient to delegate Pages and Store requests to [another program](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/224) via the [clientrpc API](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/tree/master/clientrpc), and forward its responses back to requesting BR users. This flexibility will enable useful features in the future.
- Enabled brclient to delegate requests to a HTTP or HTTPS [website](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/224). This allows BR users to access HTTP/HTTPS resources through another BR user who acts as a proxy.
- Sort posts by [most recent activity](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/243). Also unread posts will be highlighted with a different color.
- Allow to use the `/closechannel` command with a [short prefix](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/252) of the channel ID (which is 64 characters long).

Stores:

- Implemented merchant-side foundations for [simple Stores](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/224). Unlike Pages, Stores are dynamic resources that can present product items for sale. Store has a front page and individual product pages that are generated from local files. Store is reloaded automatically if any of its files changes. BR client running the store can serve product pages, maintain the shopping cart, handle order placement, and create invoices. Prices will be shown in USD but paid in DCR. Exchange rate is sourced from [dcrdata](https://explorer.dcrdata.org). Placed order is valid for 60 minutes when the DCR amount does not change. CLI app only supports on-chain payments. This iteration only adds merchant-side logic, customer-side browsing is not available yet. { _is order placement implemented?_ } { _follow-ups: 240 (clear cart)_ }
- Implemented [simple forms](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/241). Forms can be viewed, filled and submitted by store customers to add items to the shopping cart or to place an order.
- Added [shipping details](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/250) to orders. Some products may require to fill shipping info.

Other:

- Added end-to-end [performance tests](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/245).
- @JC made an onboarding event in #trading with a [giveaway](https://matrix.to/#/!lDZCzVQjFoJsXMPkvr:decred.org/$FjC6ZsHaR4GBvlR9-o4E4anuqWwoq1F167CU0QPJmS4) of 20 prepaid invites with 0.05 DCR each.

## Governance

In May the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 8,088 DCR worth $139K at May's average rate of $17.13. 3,591 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $62K at same rate.

A [treasury spend tx](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/tx/5efdb2de7cbea2682d389aa274a1ef79c5996201226054b28e08e286b1809519) was approved with 6,722 Yes votes and 52% turnout, and mined on May 20. It had 23 outputs making payments to contractors, ranging from 4 DCR to 1,464 DCR. Most of this DCR was likely paid for March work, at its billing exchange rate of $20.69 the TSpend is worth around $74K.

As of June 17, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 858,136 DCR (12.1 million USD at $14.08). 

Proposals approved in May:

- [Decred Vanguard](https://proposals.decred.org/record/0a1b782) proposal was approved for a budget of $46,784 to fund a growth of a community driven outreach program, with 94% Yes votes and turnout of 39%.

- [BTC-ECHO](https://proposals.decred.org/record/49e373b) proposal was approved for a budget of $9,500 for a three month trial with German crypto site [BTC-ECHO](https://www.btc-echo.de/) during which they produce two sponsored articles, with 69% Yes votes and turnout of 32%. Prior to the vote it was edited to include additional promotion on their social media and a 2-week ad on their podcast. Second edit clarified that they do not require upfront payment and agree to wait for the payment for up to 60 days after the campaign has ended, in line with how most existing proposals and contractors operate. After the proposal was approved they posted an [update](https://proposals.decred.org/record/49e373b/comments/24) about next steps and the timeline.

Proposals submitted in May:

- [DCRDEX Mesh Beginnings and Bonds Evolution](https://proposals.decred.org/record/4d2324b) requested $164K to develop experimental version of DCRDEX based on a server mesh architecture.

See Politeia Digest [issue 60](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue060/) for more details on the month's proposals.

## Ecosystem

New services:

- ZEC/BTC and ZEC/USDC pairs have been [launched](https://twitter.com/exitusdcr/status/1654626949837500416) at [dex.decred.org](https://dex.decred.org/).

- DGB/BTC market [went live](https://twitter.com/DecredSociety/status/1657750204852871173) at DCRDEX. DEX client version 0.6.1 or higher is required, it can be obtained as a [standalone app](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases) or with [Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases) v1.8.0. Only full node-based DGB wallet is supported initially, but built-in light wallet may become possible when DigiByte v8.22 is released.

- Decred's Matrix chat logs can now be viewed [archive.matrix.org/](https://archive.matrix.org/) - a new chat archive browser replacing [view.matrix.org](https://view.matrix.org/). The service works without JavaScript and does not require a Matrix account.

Services lost:

- Binance is [leaving Canada](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/16/binance-exits-canada-over-concerns-of-strict-regulation/) in [response](https://twitter.com/binance/status/1657099651210969088) to recent crypto regulations that prohibit registered exchanges from accepting stablecoin deposits or selling them to the customers without approval from CSA. Other restrictions include a ban on margin trading and investor limits. According to [#trading chat](https://matrix.to/#/!lDZCzVQjFoJsXMPkvr:decred.org/$Ox6W2V_jS33D6X5kOvuX6OU-TPW-8xStJL0QdLzpD8E) customers were asked via email to close any open positions by September 30, 2023.

- Binance plans to [delist 12 privacy coins](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-to-delist-privacy-tokens-in-france-italy-spain-and-poland) in France, Italy, Poland and Spain. Starting from June 26, residents of these countries will no longer be able to trade DCR. Binance has recently acquired appropriate [licenses](https://beincrypto.com/binance-privacy-coins-prohibition/) in the affected jurisdictions. The move came soon after the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) has [passed](https://cryptoslate.com/binance-delists-privacy-coins-for-european-users-amid-layoff-rumors/) in the EU on May 16.

- Hotbit [announced](https://twitter.com/Hotbit_news/status/1660496999458963458) it is shutting down operations and asks to withdraw all assets by June 30. DCR trading was available on the main hotbit.io since [October 2019](https://twitter.com/Hotbit_news/status/1186979514741428224) and on its Korean branch since [November 2020](https://twitter.com/Hotbit_Korea/status/1331412789416534017). According to some community members DCR was delisted some time ago and no DCR users should be affected. Reasons to sunset the exchange included: losses from the criminal [investigation](https://help.hotbit.io/hc/en-us/articles/8074249353495), outflow of funds from CEXes, unsustainable business model of trying to list too many coins of which many get hacked, and regulatory, and difficulties to comply with regulation. Quoting the goodbye [announcement](https://help.hotbit.io/hc/en-us/articles/14750194236823-It-s-time-to-take-a-bow): "either embrace the regulation or become more decentralized". We're on it!

Other news:

- Apparently Huobi did not delist DCR as it planned to in September 2022. The announcement page has been removed but an [archived copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20221002130913/https://www.huobi.com/support/en-us/detail/104917015223952) is available. USDT trading pairs for DCR and 6 other privacy coins from that list are still live and report good-looking volumes on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap as of May 12. Observers from the #trading chat said that DCR has never stopped flowing back and forth between Huobi and Binance.

- Bittrex has filed for [bankruptcy](https://fortune.com/2023/05/08/bittrex-bankruptcy-us-filing-crypto-platform/) in the U.S. and Malta, 3 weeks after it was charged by the SEC for operating an unregistered securities exchange. Both arms have been processing [withdrawals](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/10/bittrexs-us-maltese-arms-processed-425m-in-withdrawals-since-april-1-attorney-says/) since April.

- Ledger [announced](https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1658458714771169282) an upcoming [Ledger Recover](https://www.ledger.com/recover) service. Recover allows to register your ID (CA, EU, UK, US) and backup the wallet seed at trusted third parties. The seed is split into 3 fragments, the fragments are encrypted with a symmetric key and sent to 3 different backup providers. It can be later rebuilt on another Ledger device by verifying ID and getting 2 out of 3 fragments from the providers. Only Ledger Nano X is supported currently. DCR users may want to evaluate the [risks](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/9579368109597-Ledger-Recover-FAQs) of using Ledger in light of this new feature, which has been added in [firmware version 2.2.1](https://twitter.com/alistairmilne/status/1658381708763209729) and *should* be inactive until explicitly enabled. See more detailed coverage in [#ecosystem](https://chat.decred.org/#/room/#ecosystem:decred.org/$LSE8W9g9a4hqu9HN4IIyqWSf6H-LwSjd-xgK8Xie7GQ).

The new BRC-20 token standard for Bitcoin inscriptions (NFTs) which was launched in March has [reached](https://decrypt.co/139357/bitcoin-brc-20-tokens-near-billion-market-cap-exchanges-list-ordi) a combined (notional) market valuation of $1 Billion. This milestone was reached after ORDI, the first BRC-20 token, was listed on some major exchanges.

Bitcoin has set a new [record](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/bitcoin-sets-new-daily-transaction-record-amid-ordinals-trend-as-crypto-miners-face-potential-energy-tax/ar-AA1aXUjh) in daily transactions. The trend of minting fungible tokens with the BRC-20 standard is [spreading](https://decrypt.co/140683/meme-tokens-nfts-took-over-bitcoin-now-happening-dogecoin-litecoin) to Litecoin and Dogecoin chains, similarly raising their transaction activity levels.

There has been some [criticism](https://twitter.com/jratcliff/status/1655669410206457865) of the inefficiency of storage of the BRC-20 data on chain, suggestions that not spending the time to encode data as binary is costing 4x as much in transaction fees. The choice was [apparently](https://twitter.com/hash_bender/status/1655671019498258432) made due to a desire to have the on chain data be human-readable, but there are [suggestions](https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1655694148983312387) that using a lot more data may have been deliberate on the part of the designers.

Taproot Assets v0.2 was [released](https://lightning.engineering/posts/2023-05-16-taproot-assets-v0.2/), adding a set of tools that developers can use on testnet to issue, transfer and discover assets on the Taproot Assets Protocol daemon (formerly Taro). Taproot Assets Protocol is aiming to provide a more scalable way to handle assets on the bitcoin chain by handling most transactions off chain, as opposed to ordinal inscriptions which use block space in an inefficient manner and cause a material increase in fees for all users of the network. Version 0.2 adds support for virtual Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions” (vPSBTs), which will allow developers to more easily handle Taproot Assets. Lightning network support for assets and stablecoins is one of the big targets for a future release, geared towards use in emerging markets. 

Bittrex filed for [bankruptcy](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/08/us-crypto-exchange-bittrex-files-for-bankruptcy-in-delaware/) in Delaware but with a plan to reimburse all customer asset deposits, with the global Bittrex entity seemingly unaffected. { _does it mean only the U.S. branch filed for bankruptcy? any news/impact for Global? https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/14/bankrupt-crypto-exchange-bittrex-us-set-to-allow-withdrawals-starting-thursday/ ._ }

Ethereum's Beacon chain has been [experiencing](https://www.theblock.co/post/230680/ethereum-beacon-chain-finality-issue) some issues with finality, two episodes where validators mostly stopped proposing attestations for about an hour and nobody is sure why. Transactions on the Ethereum network have been able to continue and so users may have noticed no issues, but behind the scenes the beacon chain which finalises everything was not working so these transactions were more susceptible to reversion than would have ordinarily been the case. Ethereum core developers [released](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-s-beacon-chain-is-updated-after-finality-issues) patches for the two clients affected by the issue (Prysm labs and Teku), which had been caused by exceptionally high load on the nodes running these clients.

The Dash network and chain stalled on May 22 for 16 hours, due to a [glitch](https://www.dash.org/blog/dash-network-update/) caused by the upgrading the BLS threshold cryptography to an industry standard in v19. The core team produced a quick patch (v19.1) to halt deployment of v19 and this allowed the network to resume after 16 hours of down time. A fix for the issue and another attempt to deploy the changes will be included in v19.2.

Halborn has [documented](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/halborn-discovers-zero-day-impacting-dogecoin-and-280-networks) several issues discovered while auditing the Dogecoin codebase, but which also apply to a number of forks of the same Bitcoin lineage, including Litecoin and Zcash. They refer to these as "The Rab13s Vulnerabilities", and the most exploitable ones would allow attackers to take nodes offline, with others allowing remote code execution but only with valid credentials, making exploiting the issue more difficult.

Binance has been compiling lists of "no-progress projects" which it has listed for trade, and has started [adding](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1656231470959063041) them to the "Innovation Zone", on a pathway to delisting if they don't start demonstrating some progress. CZ has already [realized](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1656231889718353921) that this may necessitate a re-naming of the "Innovation Zone".

DeFi lending protocol AAVE [approved](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/224/) and deployed a change to its smart contracts on Ethereum, Polygon and Avalanche networks, the change was intended to adjust interest rate calculations but, due to a function formatting error, broke the protocol on the Polygon chain. User funds worth around $120M were [unavailable](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/23/aave-v2-users-temporarily-unable-to-access-120m-on-polygon-after-governance-bug/) while a proposal to fix the error worked its way through the governance process, taking around a week to resolve the issue. 

The DAO for development of OFAC-sanctioned ETH mixing service Tornado Cash was [taken over](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/21/attacker-takes-over-tornado-cash-dao-with-vote-fraud-token-slumps-40/) by a hacker who granted themselves 1.2 million TORN tokens and used these to approve spends from the DAO's Treasury fund. The code to allow the hack was recently passed within a legitimate-looking proposal which was approved by the usual Tornado DAO governance process. The hack did not affect the Tornado Cash mixer itself, but rather the smart contracts associated with the DAO. After a few days the attacker made a proposal to reset the changes they had made and [return](https://crypto.news/hacker-drops-control-over-tornado-cash-as-they-use-it-to-wash-stolen-funds/) the unspent tokens they had granted themselves, returning control to the DAO after pocketing around $900,000 of ETH mixed through Tornado Cash.

Ledger hardware wallet has been recovering from a PR [fail](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ledger-co-founder-clarifies-there-is-no-backdoor-in-recover-firmware-update) of the messaging around a new seed backup feature, Ledger recover. The CEO added fuel to the fire when he addressed concerns about seeds being exported by the new firmware by stating that users were already trusting Ledger to not deploy this kind of back door seed-exporting firmware, so he couldn't see the big deal. 

The finance ministers of the EU's Council have [signed](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/16/eus-crypto-legal-framework-inches-towards-law-with-finance-ministers-sign-off/) off on the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA), meaning that its provisions will come into force in June or July 2024. MiCA will require crypto firms to seek licenses to operate in the EU, and sets requirements like reserve holdings for stablecoins. Alongside MiCA some new measures were agreed to mandate sharing of information about crypto holdings of EU citizens with tax authorities. 

A supply chain [attack](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/fake-trezor-hardware-crypto-wallet/48155/) with a modified Trezor device has been documented. The user bought the device from an online marketplace and their crypto disappeared about a month after they started using it. Upon inspection some dodgy firmware had been installed which would cycle between 20 pre-set seeds rather than generating a random seed, and would only use the first character of any password set - so that the device could only generate 1,280 different private keys, a manageable number for the attackers to watch.

There is no event driving it beyond photos of the policy in branch or on their website FAQ, if you look you can probably find this kind of policy for many banks.
