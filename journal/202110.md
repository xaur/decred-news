## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

<a id="dcrd"></a>

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

_dcrd is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Merged changes:

- updating of indexes (transaction, address, exists address) has been made [asynchronous](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2219) to speed up the critical path of block validation and connection code. It allows for faster vote propagation and helps pave the way for other optimizations, sync models, and ultimately nicer data corruption recovery mechanisms.
- simplified to use only one latest [checkpoint](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2763), since intermediate checkpoints are no longer necessary with [headers-first syncing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2555)
- improved consistency and clarity of `txscript` package [tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2757)
- fixed handling of automatic ticket revocations when their block is [disconnected](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2768) during a chain reorganization
- fixed a data [race](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2758) in peer address management
- fixed [`findcheckpoint`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2759) and [`addblock`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2760) tools
- [libFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) support has been added to dcrd's [continuous fuzzing](https://github.com/degeri/dcrd-continuous-fuzz) test suite

<a id="dcrwallet"></a>

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

_dcrwallet is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet applications._

- implemented [`getblockheader`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2098) and [`getcurrentnet`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2102) methods in SPV mode (to be used by DCRDEX)
- added [`spv`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2094) field to `walletinfo` result to distinguish between syncing modes
- fixed [sync loss](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2099) in SPV mode

<a id="decrediton"></a>

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

_Decrediton is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

User-facing changes:

- implemented new UI design on [LN Overview](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3551) tab. Wallet, Network, and Watchtowers tabs have been grouped under a newly introduced Advanced tab.
- new UI design for wallet [modals](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3534) with added password visibility toggle
- added the ability to use [random VSP](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3560) in Automatic Ticket Purchases (with a configurable maximum fee)
- automatically enable the new [per-account](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3579) encryption for new wallets
- improved usability of the [VSP selector](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3563)
- ~13 bug fixes

Internal:

- updated DEX integration via [libdexc](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3549) to utilize upcoming 0.3 features (localized UI, restore from seed, and discovery of existing accounts)
- updated to [Electron 15](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3571)
- added a new GUI tool for [translating](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3569) strings and a [guide](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/blob/master/app/i18n/community_translators.md) for community translators
- automated tests for [Accounts](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3577) views

<a id="politeia"></a>

**[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia)**

_Politeia is Decred's proposal system. It is used to request funding from the Decred treasury._

User-facing changes:

- added a standard way to show any status change. Admin that censored or abandoned the proposal is displayed along with the reason they gave for the status change.
- support [multiple](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2629) billing status changes. The default is to only allow a single billing status change (from Active to Completed or Closed), but it is a configurable setting. If an admin makes a mistake, the sysadmin can temporarily update the setting to allow for the mistake to be corrected. It is also possible to temporarily [disable](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1533) status changes.
- improved and standardized the [identity error](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2623). The same error is now displayed anytime the user attempts to write data to Politeia without their active identity being loaded in the browser. The error message directs to the user details page to fix the issue.
- fixed multiple [comment navigation](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2638) UX issues: filtering preferences being lost, Go Back button not working properly, slow loading of individual threads, UI flickering
- ~5 other bug fixes

Changes in `politeiavoter` command-line tool:

- changed the method of [trickling](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1556) method (slow sending of votes). Previously it has sent votes in a sequence with random time intervals. This has proven to be brittle as one slow/failed send was delaying all other votes. The new method uses independent parallel voting processes that start at random times and do not affect each other, making trickling more robust.
- added an option to abort if vote trickling cannot finish with enough [extra time](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1542) prior to the vote end. It alarms the user to adjust parameters so that enough time (12 hours by default) is left to retry any failed votes, which may happen over poor connections or Tor.
- brought back printing of proposal [names](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1548) in `inventory` command

Backend and internal changes:

- added API to get billing [status changes](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1526)
- allow fetching billing status changes [in batches](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1535)
- use the server policy for [page size](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2622)
- added data integrity checks for [`ticketvote`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1531) and [`comments`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1544) plugins
- added a new `pictl` command to test the [RFP flow](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1551)
- ~4 bug fixes

Refactoring in preparation for the [user layer rewrite](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/1479) (largest chunk of work for the [2021 Q3](https://proposals.decred.org/record/91cfcc8) proposal):

- politeiawww codebase reorganized to move legacy APIs into a [`legacy`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1523) package. This will make it easier to rewrite the user layer to use a plugin architecture and to allow for horizontal scaling.
- extracted [`logger`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1527) package to allow plugins to configure their logging and become self-contained
- extracted [`websockets`](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1529) package (will make it easier to scale the servers)
- extracted [config](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1536) handling into its own package and separated out settings for legacy API for easier removal in the future
- moved [identity](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1530) handling methods to more appropriate places
- added a generic [session store](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1555) (will replace the [legacy](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1554) one that did not have proper separation of concerns)

<a id="dcrlnd"></a>

**[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd)**

_dcrlnd is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant and low-cost transactions._

- perform account discovery only [once](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/145) for embedded wallets (not applicable to remote wallets that are controlled externally)
- improved [quickstart](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/146) docs and added a new doc summarizing the 4 [operation modes](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/blob/master/docs/operation_modes.md) (dcrd or SPV sync, remote or embedded wallet)

<a id="dcrdex"></a>

**[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex)**

- start BTC SPV wallet [scan](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1249) from a certain date to save time
- require ["zpub"](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1255) extended public keys but offer to convert from "xpub" for convenience. This is for server operators willing to accept registration fees in BTC.
- ~6 bug fixes

Internal changes:

- support multiple [HD accounts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1210) for the same app seed, to allow registering additional accounts if the initial account is suspended. This change also retires legacy accounts with random keys to ensure all new accounts can be derived from app seed.
- refactored client DCR backend to support alternative [wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1227) implementations. This will be used to integrate DCRDEX into GoDCR.

Progress towards Ethereum support:

- implemented several [backend methods](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1154) ([swap](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1218) and [redeem](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1219) estimations, order [funding](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1221), message [signing](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1228), and more)
- added function to initiate a [batch](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1251) of multiple swaps in the same transaction (saves gas)
- [derive](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1225) the internal Ethereum wallet from DEX app seed

## Governance

In October the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 10,678 DCR worth $1.3 million at the month's average rate of $121.57. 974 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $118K at October's rate, or $136K at September's billing rate of $139.56. As of Nov 1, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 733,772 DCR (82.5 million USD at $112.42).

One [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/c1f5b5c) was submitted this month, @ammarooni returns with a proposal that revises an earlier book [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/9e1d644) to remove the book in favor of a steady stream of papers and social media content, memes and meetups.

The two proposals from @raedah were voted on this month, the one for [mobile wallets](https://proposals.decred.org/record/6db3c4e) was approved with 97.2% yes votes and 66% turnout, while the proposal to continue funding [GoDCR](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/proposal/f7d9fc852e309b31) was rejected with 49% approval and turnout of 73%.

See Politeia Digest [issue 47](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue047/) and [issue 48](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue048/) for more details on the month's proposals.

@richardred published numbers and graphs for Politeia's [third year](https://blockcommons.red/publication/politeia-at-3/). A few highlights:

- 31 proposals published, of which 20 approved, 11 rejected, 2 abandoned
- average (mean) voter participation improved considerably with 46% in year 3, compared to 31% in year 1 and 28% in year 2
- software development proposals have increased in count, budgets, and voter support
- marketing proposals have decreased in number so that these are no longer the dominant type, and particularly the number of marketing proposals that end with very low approval has reduced
- the proportion of proposals from people who are already contractors has gone up from 48% in year 2 to 77% in year 3
- the number of mixed tickets (those with extra privacy) has been increasing
- all-time stats for 3 years: 128 proposals published, of which 66 approved, 42 rejected, 20 abandoned

![Decred hashrate May-Oct 2021](../img/202110.7.github.png)

_Decred hashrate May-Oct 2021_

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=ku5ml4us-kvgwhe37&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between 139.7-209.7 DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at 191.6 DCR (-7.8).

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=ku5ml4us-kvgwhe37&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was 7.65-8.20 million DCR, meaning that 56.7-61.1% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=ku5ml4us-kvgwhe37&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.

![Decred ticket pool May-Oct 2021](../img/202110.8.github.png)

_Decred ticket pool May-Oct 2021_

**VSP**: On Nov 1, ~7,400 (-200) live tickets were managed by [listed](https://decred.org/vsp/) vspd servers and 224 (+4) by listed legacy dcrstakepool servers. Collectively the 7 legacy and 15 new VSPs managed 18.9% (-0.1%) of the ticket pool.

**Nodes**: Throughout October there were around 200 reachable nodes according to [dcrextdata](https://dcrextdata.planetdecred.org/nodes).

Node versions as of Nov 1 [snapshot](https://nodes.jholdstock.uk/user_agents) (245 total, dcrd only): v1.6.2 - 59%, v1.7 dev builds - 13%, v1.6.0 - 12%, v1.6.1 - 9%, v1.6 dev builds - 3%, v1.5.2 - 2%, v1.5.1 - 0.8%.

The share of [mixed coins](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&zoom=jz3q3lq8-l0s732o6&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true-true-true) varied between 52.3-54.4% and set a new all-time high with the sum of mixed unspent coins above 7.3 million.


## Ecosystem

Legacy VSP stakepool.eu has been [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pull/153) from the [VSP list](https://decred.org/vsp/) to facilitate user migration to the new [vspd system](https://blog.decred.org/2020/06/02/A-More-Private-Way-to-Stake/). It is still online to vote on the remaining live tickets (7 as of Nov 1). This VSP launched in May 2016 with the codename `India`, just 3 months after Decred was [born](https://dcrdata.decred.org/block/1). Thank you for 5 years of service!

Legacy VSP from 99split.com has handled its final live ticket and was shutdown. It has served since late 2019 and was one of the few vendors to actively support [ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher) by coordinating sessions and creating user-friendly [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StF7GF5W_eM) [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOBjep3Ll7E). Users are welcome at its new [vspd instance](https://vspd.99split.com/) with a 0.99% fee and 1.7K voted tickets.

For anyone still using legacy VSP, it is recommended to switch to [vspd providers](https://decred.org/vsp/) to avoid the risk of missed tickets, e.g. in case the legacy VSP shuts down or stops working with the coming consensus upgrades. As of Nov 1, all legacy VSPs managed less than 260 tickets or 0.6% of the ticket pool.

In October DCR was trading between USD 102.40-140.10 / BTC 0.0018-0.0025. The average daily rate was $121.57.

@tacorevenge published the [second part](https://medium.com/@tacorevenge/the-suppressor-part-2-on-chain-analysis-6561c5a478c4) of an investigation of The Suppressor entity that is suspected of manipulating DCR markets. This time on-chain analysis was used to see how funds have been flowing between miners, centralized exchanges and DCRDEX.

Zcash has been [polling](https://electriccoin.co/blog/coin-holder-poll-results-summary/) its coinholders again, this time on the subject of whether to change the consensus mechanism away from Proof of Work. 85% of the 41,000 ZEC (0.3% of circulating supply) that voted put a switch from PoW as the number one priority for the project. The aim is to move away from Proof of Work entirely, to some form of Proof of Stake or equivalent.

Sam Altman and other Silicon Valley VCs [revealed](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/25/why-everyone-is-mad-at-sam-altmans-worldcoin/) their vision for a universal basic income that people must submit unique eyeball hashes to claim, and privacy advocates have piled on to say it's a bad idea. Notable features are the orb-shaped eyeball scanners reminiscent of dystopian science fiction, and the 20% VC premine.

The latest DeFi airdrop farming [controversy](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/08/airdrop-ethics-vc-firm-draws-ire-following-25m-ribbon-finance-exploit/) concerns Ribbon Finance, where one researcher from Divergence Ventures successfully met the qualifying criteria with hundreds of different wallets and received tokens worth $2.5 million. An independent researcher noticed the pattern and identified the wallet owner through association with an ENS domain, they [suggested](https://twitter.com/gabagooldoteth/status/1446498569603756033) copytrading them on Twitter, but it blew up and Divergence Ventures ended up giving back all the airdropped tokens.

Cream Finance has been [hacked](https://rekt.news/cream-rekt-2/) for $130 million, which is the second major hack in the last 3 months. This attack used a flash loan to repeatedly lend and borrow funds across two addresses and took advantage of a pricing vulnerability to drain many of Cream's liquidity pools. [Analysis](https://mudit.blog/cream-hack-analysis/) by a DeFi insider suggests that this hack was executed by a skilled DeFi developer, likely working on a rival project. The attacker also left a cryptic message which appeared to taunt a list of projects and blame Yearn developers, and some DeFi developers have started referring to a "[war](https://decrypt.co/84840/behind-defi-war-words-aave-yearn)" in their tweets.

The DeFi protocol Indexed Finance was [hacked](https://decrypt.co/83681/defi-protocol-indexed-finance-hacked-for-16-million-team-finds-hacker) for $16 million, but [identified](https://cryptobriefing.com/inside-the-war-room-how-indexed-finance-traced-its-16m-hacker/) the attacker. The [story](https://cryptobriefing.com/inside-the-war-room-how-indexed-finance-traced-its-16m-hacker/) of how the attacker was identified is an interesting one, involving an edit to Wikipedia which they made to describe themselves as a "notable mathematician". It subsequently transpired that the attacker is a [teenager](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/22/after-stealing-16m-this-teen-hacker-seems-intent-on-testing-code-is-law-in-the-courts/), and rather than hand the funds back, or 90%, they have decided to test the "code is law" conjecture in court to see if they can keep their flash loan bounty.

The Creature Toadz NFT community was [scammed](https://cryptobriefing.com/hacker-admits-to-stealing-88-eth-then-returns-it/) by an attacker who posted a fake minting link in their Discord - in the 45 minutes before it was taken down 88 ETH was sent to the attacker. The funds were quickly returned after the hacker's identity was discovered.

In the dog eat dog world of [dog money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbI31x3FpS0), AnubisDAO executed a speedy [rug pull](https://decrypt.co/84924/anubisdao-investors-lose-60-million-in-alleged-rug-pull) with $60 million of investors' money, 20 hours into the initial token sale for this new dog token with no website. There is some dispute over whether the attack was executed by a project insider or someone who phished a project insider.

A new crypto news wire has launched, and it is run by a DAO, [PubDAO](https://decrypt.co/84755/pubdao-media-dao-decentralized-news-wire).

Popular patronage service Patreon is [considering](https://decrypt.co/84831/patreon-creators-fans-crypto-social-tokens) to drop the ban on its users offering and promoting social tokens on their platform.

The infamous $1 trillion infrastructure bill has returned to the house of representatives and someone has discovered an even more egregious anti-crypto provision: [6050I](https://unchainedpodcast.com/not-reporting-info-on-some-transaction-partners-could-soon-be-a-felony/). This provision would require recipients of digital assets to, in many cases, collect a variety of information about the sender and report this to the IRS within 15 days. This provision has only recently been discovered, but it is [apparently](https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1456275741398683648) already too late to do anything about amending the infrastructure bill on its passage through the house of representatives.

The latest crypto [fad](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tungsten-cubes-bitcoin-gamestop-crypto-investors-11635431036) is not a new blockchain but small blocks of tungsten, which people are buying to touch and hold. It didn't take long for someone to come up with a [Tungsten DAO](https://twitter.com/tungsten_dao) which has minted an NFT representing a very large block of tungsten, and [sold](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761305/tungsten-cube-meme-nft-crypto-midwest) this for $250,000, to a holder who is entitled to visit it once a year for looking and touching (it's too heavy to hold or deliver).
