## Core Software v1.7.5 Released

Highlights of the [v1.7.5 release](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1581003123287461888):

- **dcrd** got UTXO cache updates to improve its robustness, optimize it, and correct some hard to hit corner cases that involve a mix of manual block invalidation, conditional flushing, and successive unclean shutdowns.

- **dcrwallet** gained a method for importing public keys to watching-only wallets, and gRPC methods to command VSPs how they should vote on treasury spends. Fixes include: `signrawtransaction` now respects the private keys passed to it, auto ticket buyer no longer attempts to mix change if the server is unknown, and the list of nodes discovered from seeders is no longer limited to a deprecated SPV version. Finally, this release enforces testnet3 hardfork to prevent ASICs from halting the test network.

- **Decredition** was mainly updated due to a critical fix included in DCRDEX v0.5.4. Other small bug fixes and improvements include a fix of the never ending loading button on the Treasury Spending tab.

Visit the [GitHub release](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases) for the full list of changes and downloads. As always, we recommend to [verify the files](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/verifying-binaries) before running.

Users of the standalone **DCRDEX app** should upgrade to the [latest release here](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases), specifically to avoid issues with certain Taproot transactions on Bitcoin, which were fixed in v0.5.4 and v0.5.5.


## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

- Utilize [server context](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3011) when connecting to peers to make shutdown more responsive.
- Use [context in RPC tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3012). It allows two things: test that cancellation and shutdown work correctly, and to be able to abort the test if necessary.
- Make sure peer address is [added to address manager](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3013). It helps speed up discovery of new nodes on the network by ensuring they are added to the list of addresses that need to be tried in order to build reputation when they haven't otherwise been seen before.


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

- Multiple fixes of [context usage](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2188). "Contexts" are used to signal to various services running concurrently that they must stop as part of a graceful wallet shutdown.


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

- Upgraded DCRDEX module [to v0.5.3](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3812) and then [to v0.5.4](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3816). The latter includes a critical fix to Bitcoin block parsing.
- Updated [English strings for translation](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3807). The codebase is periodically scanned for text shown on the UI and that text is collected in a special file that can be translated with an assistant web tool. In other words, the originals are fresh and now is good time to [translate](https://decredcommunity.github.io/translations/status#decrediton).


### Politeia

_[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia) is Decred's proposal system. It is used to request funding from the Decred treasury._

`politeiavoter` command-line app:

- Consolidated [voting logic](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1682) by creating votes without the signatures first and then obtaining the signatures from the wallet. This approach is simpler and less error prone.

GUI remake on the new [plugin architecture](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/tree/master/plugins-structure#politeiagui---plugins-structure):

- Implemented proposal [vote search](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2863).
- Implemented proposal [author updates](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2860), previews of comments replied to in flat mode, and single comment links.
- Implemented proposal [votes download](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2865).
- Improved [code splitting and chunks cache](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2868), and reduced app bundle from 1.5 MB to 0.7 MB (uncompressed size).
- Fixes and refactoring.

pi-ui library (shared by Politeia and Decrediton):

- [Optimized building](https://github.com/decred/pi-ui/pull/466) and enabled compression, reducing bundle size from 740 KB to 430 KB.
- Dependency and testing improvements.


### Lightning Network

_[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant and low-cost transactions._

- Timestamp of the [last received gossip message](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/165) is now persisted. Upon restarting, it is sent to a remote peer to request messages since that timestamp. This allows nodes that were offline for some time to fetch missed gossip messages (in particular, ChannelUpdates) to update their local view of the network correctly. Before this change, a node that remained offline long enough could miss many ChannelUpdate-s and incorrectly mark existing channels as zombies in the database.
- [Maintenance](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/165): updated minimum Go version to 1.18, updated to new formatting, dependency bumps.


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

[v0.5.4 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.5.4):

- Updated upstream btcd to fix a critical Bitcoin [block parsing failure](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1897). There are now blocks on Bitcoin mainnet and testnet that include bigger Taproot transactions that cannot be deserialized by btcd v0.23.1 and older. The issue affects takers that use full node (RPC) or SPV wallets.

User-facing changes merged in `master`:

- Show new matches dynamically [without having to reload](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1864) the Orders page.
- Restyled the [Markets page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1825) and made it responsive across desktop, tablet and mobile layouts.
- Reject [invalid addresses](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1840) on Send form. Also fixed handling when fee estimation is unsupported or has failed, so that sending is possible even without fee estimates.
- Support [custom wallet path](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1870) for Electrum wallets. Also, support unprotected Electrum wallets (those having no password).
- Updated [Chinese translation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1871).
- Show an error when the user attempts to logout while having [active orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1904).
- Fixed the [accelerate order button](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1847) not hiding after the swap tx is mined.
- Added a [form](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1916) to delete archived records (orders and matches) from the client, and an option to export deleted records as CSV files.
- Fixed multiple UI bugs on the [Markets page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1890).
- Fixed a case where clients could stay unaware that their [orders have been revoked](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1865) due to an upcoming market suspension.
- ~2 other bug fixes.

Internal and developer changes:

- Fixed recovery for [not connected wallets](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1891) and added support for recovering disabled wallets.
- Implemented foundations for DCR [fidelity bonds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1818): bond transaction structure, common interfaces to create/broadcast/refund bonds (for client), parsing and validation of bond tx (for server). Time-locked [fidelity bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_bond) will replace the current registration fee system. Bonds will be redeemable by the user who posted the bond after a certain time, to create an opportunity cost to use DCRDEX instead of a simple monetary cost. It also is a prerequisite for building a [server mesh](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1765). To make the transition smoother, the client and server retain all the legacy registration fee machinery, and the clients continue to use the legacy registration system for now.
- Numerous improvements to test stability, localization system, and the documentation.
- Expire [request timeouts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1915) when WebSocket connection is closed, to avoid hangs on shutdown.
- Fixed [locked balance](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1918) calculation for ZEC. This required to implement a workaround for the wallet not unlocking spent coins automatically. Currently DOGE and ZEC require this quirk.
- Fixed and improved [simnet tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1909). Most tests will run twice, alternating the maker and taker between clients. This has helped to discover a few bugs.
- Fixed HTML template parsing for keys [containing dash](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1923) (welcome to DCRDEX, [@norwnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commits?author=norwnd)!).
- ~2 other bug fixes.

Ethereum support:

- Improved [ETH wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1893) connection management.
- Added [gas limits](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1894) in ETH and ETH token wallets so that at most 1/4 of the gas limit of a block can be filled up by a swap or redeem transaction. This should prevent some huge [unswappable orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1771).
- Implemented [RPC client](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1832) for communicating with an Ethereum node over WebSockets, HTTP or IPC connections.

### Documentation

_[dcrdocs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs) is the source code for Decred [user documentation](https://docs.decred.org/)._

- Updated [mkdocs-material theme](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1210). One of the new features is auto-generated social cards.
- Reworked some of the page titles to make more sense when displayed on their own (e.g. "Overview" becomes "Governance Overview").


### decred.org

_[dcrweb](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb) is the source code for the [decred.org](https://decred.org/) website._

- Updated all links and tags for [v1.7.5 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1091). 
- Added [category filters](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1090) to `/news`. This allows viewers to easily switch between Software Releases, Decred Journal, Press Releases, and media Coverage of Decred. Each category has a [direct link](https://decred.org/news/#software_releases) and they work without JavaScript.
- Added "News" translation for [Polish and Chinese](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1084).
- Ensure news posts are always [sorted](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1084) by date.
- Added a large number of [news posts](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1084) consisting of previous releases.
- Fixed [overlapping](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1084) text and buttons on press page.
- Renamed "Press" to "News" and [added a link](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1084) to `/news` in the header navigation bar, making [Decred News](https://decred.org/news/) more accessible. 
- Added [`/vsp` link](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1084) to footer so users can easily find Voting Service Providers.
- Moved [Internationalization (translation) content into sub-directories](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1086). This fixes an issue where translated Press Releases were not displayed in non-English languages, and allowed the removal of over 100 empty files.

### Other

[dcrseeder](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder) - node crawler that builds a list of reliable Decred nodes and is used by new nodes to bootstrap their connectivity:

- Do not add [RFC6598](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder/pull/54) ([Carrier-Grade NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT)) addresses. The global dcrseeder should not return these addresses to Decred nodes because they are reserved for private networks and cannot be reliably connected to from any node on the Internet.
- Converted to use [`netip`](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder/pull/55) package for managing network addresses.
- Check if node's uptime is [long enough](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder/pull/57) to be considered "Good".

[release](https://github.com/decred/release) - automation tool for making [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/) of Decred software:

- [Updated](https://github.com/decred/release/pull/64) to build core software v1.7.5, DCRDEX v0.5.4, Politeia v1.4.0.
- Use system's native DNS resolver on [Windows](https://github.com/decred/release/pull/65) and on [macOS and OpenBSD](https://github.com/decred/release/pull/66), instead of the Go fallback resolver.


## People

We have two new interviews with Decred community members.

[Tiago Alves Dulce](https://www.decredmagazine.com/tiago-alves-dulce-developer-q-a/) (@tiagoalvesdulce) shared his story and thoughts on contributing as a Politeia developer.

> Victor was pretty passionate about cryptocurrencies and used to pitch it to us all the time. Fernando and I were still skeptical about it. At the end of 2017, Victor started contributing to Decred, and we decided to take a look into it. We liked what we saw. It was a good opportunity to contribute to a cool open-source project, and we started doing it at the beginning of 2018. As time went by, I researched more and more about the project and got pretty passionate about it.

Eduardo Lima (@elima\_iii) joined the [State of the Market](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COfKWnl7IYs) episode to talk about his legal research paper "But Who is in Charge of Decred?", his status with the project, and many other topics.

> I believe that some of the heroes of all of this, of civil liberties, truthfully, are the software developers. The people who are building the technology. (...) Decred is kind of already future-proof, but if we don't fight for our right for peer-to-peer exchange, if we don't fight for our right for privacy, if we don't fight for our right to not be censored and not be banned, and have due process of law before you have your assets just taken and frozen, if we don't fight for these things, they will not be given to us. And so I say thank you to those developers out there.

## Ecosystem

Biggest VSP [stakey.com](http://vspd.stakey.com/) is having issues since around Sep 20 when it had 2,183 tickets - 28% of all VSP tickets or 5% of all live tickets. The [API endpoint](https://vspd.stakey.com/api/v3/vspinfo) does not respond and the data returned by decred.org [VSP API](https://api.decred.org/?c=vsp) is outdated. Service operator @dema501 [commented](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pull/171#issuecomment-1279775352) that voting wallets are functional but the API server is in limbo. [Missed Votes](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=missed-votes) chart at dcrdata confirms there have been no spikes in missed tickets as of Nov 14.

Binance [added DCR](https://twitter.com/binance/status/1582933735019663361) to its [Simple Earn Flexible Products](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-adds-new-assets-to-simple-earn-flexible-products-2022-10-20-87e0f4b74c884d83b09ae4f3c2fd7b82). The service allows to deposit DCR for a flexible amount of time and receive daily rewards (about 2.5% APR according to [one report](https://matrix.to/#/!teQafvHMYpIbqLIieU:decred.org/$pmPmtx4rOLeKs5NUZl-Dg4YxgUZQwGQwd5hQLkqRT3g?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=t2bot.io)). Simple Earn has [replaced](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/introducing-simple-earn-the-evolution-of-binance-savings-binance-staking-b067f764f4f14e5aa46cca1bf2b55ab8) Binance Savings and Binance Staking platforms, and its [Flexible Products](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/get-started-with-binance-simple-earn-flexible-products-3bd1a6eba20a445da1e94bf6cfa52e80) component is a new name for Flexible Savings.

decred.org updates:

- Added [ChangeNOW](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1093) to [Exchanges page](https://decred.org/exchanges/).
- Removed [mobile wallets](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1092) from [Wallets page](https://decred.org/wallets/) because they are no longer maintained.

Decred adoption:

- Government plans from Brazilian presidential candidate Lula da Silva and SÃ£o Paulo government candidate Fernando Haddad were timestamped on Decred blockchain to combat fake news. This can be verified by downloading the PDFs from the [announcement](https://haddadoficial.com.br/lula-e-haddad-registram-plano-de-governo-em-blockchain-para-evitar-fake-news/), computing their SHA-256 and checking those hashes on [timestamp.decred.org](https://timestamp.decred.org/). Previously in Brazil, Decred timestamping was used in Haddad's [2018 campaign](https://web.archive.org/web/20181106225509/https://www.obrasilfelizdenovo.com/haddad-blockchain-bitcoin-plano-governo/) for the president, and in 2020 SÃ£o Paulo [municipal elections](https://www.decredmagazine.com/how-decred-how-decred-contributed-to-a-more-transparent-election-in-brazil/) via the [VotoLegal](https://blockchain.votolegal.com.br/) platform.

October was a big month for crypto hacks and exploits, by the 13th there had [already](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/13/october-becomes-worst-month-for-crypto-hacks-with-two-weeks-to-go/) been 11 different DeFi attacks in which $718 million was obtained by hackers. One that stands out is Mango Markets, which was [hit](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/12/how-market-manipulation-led-to-a-100m-exploit-on-solana-defi-exchange-mango/) for a $100M exploit when a trader manipulated some prices to borrow all of the assets on the platform. One of the attackers [tweeted](https://twitter.com/avi_eisen/status/1581326197241180160) about a "highly profitable trading strategy" which they had engaged in, after a settlement had been negotiated with the platform which would allow other depositors to regain access to their funds. Another quirk of the story is that the attacker made a proposal to resolve the situation with no criminal charges and the [voted](https://twitter.com/alex_valaitis/status/1580017142132805632) for it with some of the tokens they obtained from the exploit.

Kim Kardashian has [settled](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/03/us-sec-charges-kim-kardashian-for-promoting-ethereummax/) with the SEC, agreeing to pay $1.26M over her undisclosed shilling of EthereumMax in 2021. SEC Chief Gary Gensler has been [promoting](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1576897535427448832) this as a big win.

Rune's "Endgame" proposal for Maker DAO has been approved, and it has been [noted](https://twitter.com/SebVentures/status/1584875892555268096) that the majority of delegated MKR voting for it is controlled by Rune.
