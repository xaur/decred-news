## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover its most notable dev work._
- _For each project, the order of reporting is "most released first": changes released to end users, merged to master, in progress (work started), discussions and future plans._
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

- Use [context in RPC tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3012). { _Is it to test that cancellation/shutdown works or to be able to cancel/abort the test itself?_ }
- Make sure peer address is [added to address manager](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3013). { _Is it a bugfix? If so, what was the bug?_ }

Merged in v0.5.4 release:

- Updated btcd to fix a critical Bitcoin block parsing failure. There are now blocks on Bitcoin mainnet and testnet that include bigger Taproot transactions that cannot be deserialized by btcd v0.23.1 and older. The issue affects both full node RPC and SPV wallets.

User-facing changes merged in master:

- Show the user new matches [without having to reload]({a461a3}) the Order page.
- Restyled the [Markets page]({7f0ef469}) to make it responsive and adjust colors and logos.
- Reject [invalid addresses]({15d1513}) on Send form.
- Support [custom wallet path]({d233da7}) for Electrum wallets.
- Support [unprotected Electrum wallets]({1c6241c0}) (that have no password).
- [Hide Wallet Settings]({722c6a541}) header when there are none without defaults. { _What does this mean?_ }
- Updated [Chinese translation]({89273503d}).
- Show an error when the user attempts to logout while having [active orders]({d46c4ba}).
- Show or hide the [Accelerate]({eb0063d}) button dynamically.
- Added a [form]({9e50edea3}) to delete archived records (orders and matches) from the client, with optional saving deleted records in CSV files.
- Fixed handling when [fee estimation]({70452}) is unsupported or has failed.
- Fixed multiple UI bugs on the [Markets page]({c0c01899}).
- Fixed RPC config comparison in [live reconfiguration]({ba711d}) of Electrum wallets.
- Fixed a case where clients could stay unaware that their [orders have been revoked]({c9b1aed}) due to an upcoming market suspension.
- Fixed an error when creating an [external wallet]({ccd5edf1}).

Internal and developer changes:

- Support recovery even for [disabled or not connected wallets]({c33ffdf}).
- Formalized transaction structure for refundable [DCR fidelity bonds]({e8778d7}).
- Added common interfaces of creating, broadcasting, and refunding [fidelity bonds]({1127e5b2}) and implemented them for Decred.
- Added [bond validation]({3ae066}) implementation for Decred.
- Moved hard-coded [tooltip strings]({910370}) to translation files.
- Fixed [locktime check]({1619a9c}) { _minor, unreleased_ }
- Improved stability of [swap tests]({a895ff}). { _merge with testing stuff_ }
- Improved stability of [wallet syncing tests]({6ba5dd4}). { _merge with testing stuff_ }
- Removed [duplicate translations]({d60649}). { _merge with maintenantce_ }

- Return explicit [locked balance]({b3fddff0}) for ZEC-like coins.
- Implemented the [`UnlockSpends`]({adfdb2fa}) quirk for `listlockunspent` command that returns unspent but locked outputs. Most assets unlock wallet outputs automatically as they are spent, but some require special handling, currently DOGE and ZEC.
- Added [release notes]({5550e84}) for v0.5.3 and v0.5.4. { _minor, merge with documentation_ }
- Fixed and improved [simnet tests]({2294caee}). Most tests will run twice, alternating the maker and taker between clients.
- Fixed HTML template parsing for keys [containing dash]({0c1aac}). { _minor, group_ }
- Fixed panic in [WebSocket]({7a949b88}) method for loading candles.

Ethereum support:

- Improved [ETH wallet]({7247ed}) connection management.

## Governance

{ _Hint: Currently this is a mix of finances and governance. We may add the separate Finances section in the future._ }

In October the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 8,850 DCR worth $241K at October's average rate of $27.19. 2,645 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $72K at October's rate, and on this occasion September's billing rate of $27.19 was exactly the same.

The Treasury spend [tx](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/f79381e591ef46c9ed911d936a9c329d62ac63cd9674d9c2db5855d2e4317358) had 31 outputs making payments to contractors, ranging from 2.3 DCR to 1028 DCR.

{ _Treasury spend tx recap: how many outputs, min, max DCR_ }

{ _Any other activity with the legacy or new treasury._ }

As of Nov 1, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 824,840 DCR (22.5 million USD at $27.28).

A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/d5221a9) to continue retaining the services of Monde PR for another year at a cost of $48,000 was approved with 66% Yes votes and voter turnout of 59%.

A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/0848cc9) to fund work done on the @[dcrtimestampbot](https://twitter.com/dcrtimestampbot) twitter bot at a cost of $1,955 was submitted by @coinshuffle_bot and is under review.

## Network

{ _Hint: n, n.n, and n.nn tell how many decimals to keep, e.g. 100, 16.5, 8.63_ }

**Hashrate**: October's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) {_set zoom to show the month_} opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of {} Ph/s hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) {_monthly zoom_} varied between {n}-{n} DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}). { use same t1-t2 for zoom }

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) {_monthly zoom_} was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, meaning that {n.n}-{n.n}% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) {_monthly zoom_} in Proof of Stake.

{ _Add a recap of ticket price action if it was interesting._ }
