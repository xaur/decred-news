## Core Software v1.7.5 Released

{ highlights, links, signature check reminder, optional image }

https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.7.5


## DCRDEX v0.5.4 Released

{ what was fixed, maybe drop this section and resort to Dev/DCRDEX if too small }

https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.5.4


## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

- Utilize [server context](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3011) when connecting to peers to make shutdown more responsive. { _Correct?_ }
- Use [context in RPC tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3012). { _Is it to test that cancellation/shutdown works, or to be able to cancel/abort the test itself?_ }
- Make sure peer address is [added to address manager](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3013). { _Is it a bugfix? If so, what was the bug?_ }
- Fixed [database upgrade](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3010) logic. { _Was it an edge case? How to describe the problem that was fixed?_ }


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

- Multiple fixes of [context usage](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2188). "Contexts" are used to signal to various services running concurrently that they must stop as part of a graceful wallet shutdown. { _Wording ok?_ }


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

- Upgraded DCRDEX module [to v0.5.3](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3812) and then [to v0.5.4](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3816). The latter includes a critical fix to Bitcoin block parsing.
- Updated [English strings for translation](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3807). The codebase is periodically scanned for text shown on the UI and that text is collected in a special file that can be translated with an assistant web tool. In other words, the originals are fresh and now is good time to [translate](https://decredcommunity.github.io/translations/status#decrediton). { _normally I'd call it minor but we can highlight it to say that it's good time to translate_ }


### Politeia

_[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia) is Decred's proposal system. It is used to request funding from the Decred treasury._

`politeiavoter` command-line app:

- Consolidated [voting logic](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1682) by creating votes without the signatures first and then obtaining the signatures from the wallet. This approach is simpler and less error prone.

GUI remake on the new [plugin architecture](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/tree/master/plugins-structure#politeiagui---plugins-structure):

- Implemented proposal [vote search](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2863).
- Implemented proposal [author updates](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2860), previews of comments replied to in flat mode, and single comment links.
- Implemented proposal [votes download](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2865).
- Improved [code splitting and chunks cache](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2868), and reduced app bundle from 1.5 MB to 0.7 MB (uncompressed size).
- Fixes and refactoring. { 2867 2870 }

pi-ui library (shared by Politeia and Decrediton):

- [Optimized building](https://github.com/decred/pi-ui/pull/466) and enabled compression, reducing bundle size from 740 KB to 430 KB.
- Dependency { 464 467 } and testing { 465 } improvements.


### Lightning Network

_[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant and low-cost transactions._

- Timestamp of the [last received gossip message](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/165) is now persisted. Upon restarting, it is sent to a remote peer to request messages since that timestamp. This allows nodes that were offline for some time to fetch missed gossip messages (in particular, ChannelUpdates) to update their local view of the network correctly. Before this change, a node that remained offline long enough could miss many ChannelUpdate-s and incorrectly mark existing channels as zombies in the database.
- [Maintenance](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/165): updated minimum Go version to 1.18, updated to new formatting, dependency bumps.


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

Merged in [v0.5.4 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.5.4):

- Updated btcd to fix a critical Bitcoin [block parsing failure](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1897). There are now blocks on Bitcoin mainnet and testnet that include bigger Taproot transactions that cannot be deserialized by btcd v0.23.1 and older. The issue affects takers that use full node RPC or SPV wallets.

User-facing changes merged in `master`:

- Show new matches dynamically [without having to reload](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1864) the Orders page.
- Restyled the [Markets page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1825) and made it responsive across desktop, tablet and mobile layouts.
- Reject [invalid addresses](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1840) on Send form. Also fixed handling when fee estimation is unsupported or has failed, so that sending is possible even without fee estimates.
- Support [custom wallet path](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1870) for Electrum wallets. Also, support unprotected Electrum wallets (those having no password).
- Updated [Chinese translation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1871).
- Show an error when the user attempts to logout while having [active orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1904).
- Fixed the [accelerate order button](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1847) not hiding after the swap tx is mined.
- Added a [form](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1916) to delete archived records (orders and matches) from the client, and an option to export deleted records as CSV files.
- Fixed multiple UI bugs on the [Markets page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1890).
- Fixed a case where clients could stay unaware that their [orders have been revoked](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1865) due to an upcoming market suspension.
- Fixed ~2 other bugs { 1845 1913 }.

Internal and developer changes:

- Fixed recovery for [not connected wallets](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1891) and added support for recovering disabled wallets.
- Implemented foundations for DCR [fidelity bonds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1818): bond transaction structure, common interfaces to create/broadcast/refund bonds (for client), parsing and validation of bond tx (for server). Time-locked [fidelity bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_bond) will replace the current registration fee system. Bonds will be redeemable by the user who posted the bond after a certain time, to create an opportunity cost to use DCRDEX instead of a simple monetary cost. It also is a prerequisite for building a [server mesh](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1765). To make the transition smoother, the client and server retain all the legacy registration fee machinery, and the clients continue to use the legacy registration system for now.
- Expire [request timeouts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1915) when WebSocket connection is closed, to avoid hangs on shutdown.
- Fixed [locked balance](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1918) calculation for ZEC. This required to implement a workaround for the wallet not unlocking spent coins automatically. Currently DOGE and ZEC require this quirk.
- Documentation improvements { 1899, commit 7291243 }
- Translation system improvements { 1902 1910 }
- Fixed and improved [simnet tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1909). Most tests will run twice, alternating the maker and taker between clients. This has helped to discover a few bugs.
- Test stability improvements { 1737 1914 1926 }
- Fixed HTML template parsing for keys [containing dash](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1923) (welcome to DCRDEX, [@norwnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commits?author=norwnd)!).
- Fixed panic in [WebSocket](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1928) method for loading candles. { _merge?_ }
- Fixed ~{} other bugs { 1907 }.

Ethereum support:

- Improved [ETH wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1893) connection management.
- Added [gas limits](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1894) in ETH and ETH token wallets so that at most 1/4 of the gas limit of a block can be filled up by a swap or redeem transaction. This should prevent some huge [unswappable orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1771).
- Implemented [RPC client](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1832) for communicating with an Ethereum node over WebSockets, HTTP or IPC connections.

### Documentation

_[dcrdocs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs) is the source code for Decred [user documentation](https://docs.decred.org/)._

- Updated [mkdocs-material theme](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1210). One of the new features is auto-generated social cards.
- Reworked some of the page titles to make more sense when displayed on their own (e.g. "Overview" becomes "Governance Overview").


### decred.org

_[dcrweb](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb) is the source code for the [decred.org](https://decred.org/) website._

- Added [ChangeNOW](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1093) exchange and specified direct DCR URLs for other instant exchanges that support it.
- Removed [mobile wallets](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1092) from the [Wallets page](https://decred.org/wallets/) because they are no longer maintained.
- Updated all links and tags for [v1.7.5 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1091). 
- Added [category filters](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1090) to `/news`. This allows viewers to easily switch between Software Releases, Decred Journal, Press Releases, and media Coverage of Decred. Each category has a [direct link](https://decred.org/news/#software_releases) and they work without JavaScript.
- Added DCRDEX v0.5 [Press Release](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1085). { _reported in September's Media, maybe drop_ }
- Added "News" translation for [Polish and Chinese](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1084).
- Ensure news posts are always [sorted](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1084) by date.
- Added a large number of [news posts](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1084) consisting of previous releases.
- Fixed [overlapping](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1084) text and buttons on press page.
- Renamed "Press" to "News" and [added a link](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1084) to `/news` in the header navigation bar, making [Decred News](https://decred.org/news/) more accessible. 
- Added [`/vsp` link](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1084) to footer so users can easily find Voting Service Providers.
- Moved [Internationalization (translation) content into sub-directories](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1086). This fixes an issue where translated Press Releases were not displayed in non-English languages, and allowed the removal of over 100 empty files.

{ _maybe move some content updates to Ecosystem_ }

{ _image: news page screenshot_ }


### Other

[dcrseeder](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder) - a crawler for the Decred network, which exposes a list of reliable nodes via a built-in HTTP server:

- Added [RFC6598](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder/pull/54) (Carrier-Grade NAT address block) as not routable. { _maybe explain a bit_ }
- Converted to use [`netip`](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder/pull/55) package for managing network addresses.
- Check if host's uptime is [long enough](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder/pull/57) to be considered "Good".

## Relevant External

{ _Hint: Besides dramatic "epic fails", try to also report some "epic wins" in areas relevant to Decred. We can learn from both._ }

{ _Hint: Follow or not follow the suggested grouping of stories below._ }

{ _Cryptocurrency L1 tech: PoW, ASIC resistance, full nodes, network security, etc._ }

{ _L2+ tech: "Smart" contracts, DEX projects._ }

October was a big month for crypto hacks and exploits, by the 13th there had [already](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/13/october-becomes-worst-month-for-crypto-hacks-with-two-weeks-to-go/) been 11 different DeFi attacks in which $718 million was obtained by hackers. One that stands out is Mango Markets, which was [hit](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/12/how-market-manipulation-led-to-a-100m-exploit-on-solana-defi-exchange-mango/) for a $100M exploit when a trader manipulated some prices to borrow all of the assets on the platform. One of the attackers [tweeted](https://twitter.com/avi_eisen/status/1581326197241180160) about a "highly profitable trading strategy" which they had engaged in, after a settlement had been negotiated with the platform which would allow other depositors to regain access to their funds. Another quirk of the story is that the attacker made a proposal to resolve the situation with no criminal charges and the [voted](https://twitter.com/alex_valaitis/status/1580017142132805632) for it with some of the tokens they obtained from the exploit.

Kim Kardashian has [settled](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/03/us-sec-charges-kim-kardashian-for-promoting-ethereummax/) with the SEC, agreeing to pay $1.26M over her undisclosed shilling of EthereumMax in 2021. SEC Chief Gary Gensler has been [promoting](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1576897535427448832) this as a big win.

Rune's "Endgame" proposal for Maker DAO has been approved, and it has been [noted](https://twitter.com/SebVentures/status/1584875892555268096) that the majority of delegated MKR voting for it is controlled by Rune.
