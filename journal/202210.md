}


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commits/master }

- Added [v1.7.5 release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3009) { _minor_ }
- Utilize [server context](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3011) when connecting to peers to make shutdown more responsive. { _Correct?_ }
- Use [context in RPC tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3012). { _Is it to test that cancellation/shutdown works or to be able to cancel/abort the test itself?_ }
- Make sure peer address is [added to address manager](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3013). { _Is it a bugfix? If so, what was the bug?_ }
- Fixed [database upgrade](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3010) logic. { _Was it an edge case? How to describe the problem that was fixed?_ }

### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commits/master }

- Multiple fixes of [context usage](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2188). "Contexts" are commonly used to signal to various services running concurrently that they must stop as part of a graceful wallet shutdown. { _Wording ok?_ }


### dcrctl

_[dcrctl](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl) is a command-line client for dcrd and dcrwallet._

{ _Hint: dcrctl is pulling most of the code from dcrd and dcrwallet. Often there is not much to report and this section can be removed._ }

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/commits/master }

- [Updated README.md](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/pull/52) for v1.7.5 release.


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/decrediton/commits/master }

- Bumped to [DCRDEX v0.5.4](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3816).
- Regenerated 'original.json' [strings for translations](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3807).
- Bumped to [DCRDEX v0.5.3](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3812).


### Politeia

_[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia) is Decred's proposal system. It is used to request funding from the Decred treasury._

{ _Check these repos:_

- https://github.com/decred/politeia/commits/master
- https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/commits/master
- https://github.com/decred/pi-ui/commits/master

}

`politeiavoter` command-line app:

- Consolidates [voting logic](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1682) by creating votes without the signatures first and then obtaining the signatures from the wallet. This approach is simpler and less error prone.

GUI remake on the new [plugin architecture](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/tree/master/plugins-structure#politeiagui---plugins-structure):

- Proposal [vote search](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2863).
- Proposal [author updates](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2860), previews of comments replied to in flat mode, and single comment links.
- Proposal [votes download](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2865).
- Improved [code splitting and chunks cache](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2868) and reduced app bundle from 1.5 MB to 0.7 MB (uncompressed).
- Fixes and refactoring. { 2867 2870 }

pi-ui library (shared by Politeia and Decrediton):

- [Optimized building](https://github.com/decred/pi-ui/pull/466) and enabled compression, reducing bundle size from 740 KB to 430 KB.
- Dependency { 464 467 } and testing { 465 } improvements.


### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software for running a Voting Service Provider. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/vspd/commits/master }

In Progress:

- Add [types module](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/356) for API requests/responses/errors.


### Lightning Network

_[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant and low-cost transactions._

{ _Check these repos:_

- https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/commits/master
- https://github.com/decred/dcrlnlpd/commits/master

}

- [Bumped build](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/167) to v0.3.7.
- Now uses last [gossip timestamp](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/165) in gossip queries.

This modifies the gossiper subsystem to persist the timestamp of the
last received gossip message during active sync so that, upon restarting
the sync, gossip messages generated after the stored timestamp will be
relayed from the remote host to the local one.

This is needed to ensure that a node that remains offline for some time
will still be able to fetch gossip messages (in particular,
ChannelUpdates) to update their local view of the network correctly.

Before this commit, a node that remained offline for a significant
fraction of time could miss many ChannelUpdate messages for existing
channels, such that the channel would eventually be marked as zombie in
the database.
- [Updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/165) go.mod to v1.18.


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

{ _Check these repos:_

- https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commits/master
- https://github.com/decred/dexweb/commits/master

}

Merged in v0.5.4 release:

- Updated btcd to fix a critical Bitcoin [block parsing failure](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1897). There are now blocks on Bitcoin mainnet and testnet that include bigger Taproot transactions that cannot be deserialized by btcd v0.23.1 and older. The issue affects takers that use full node RPC or SPV wallets.

User-facing changes merged in master:

- Show new matches dynamically [without having to reload](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1864) the Orders page.
- Restyled the [Markets page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1825) and made it responsive across desktop, tablet and mobile layouts.
- Reject [invalid addresses](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1840) on Send form. Also fixed handling when fee estimation is unsupported or has failed, so that sending is possible even without fee estimates.
- Support [custom wallet path](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1870) for Electrum wallets. Also, support unprotected Electrum wallets (those having no password).
- Fixed inconsistent UI when the [Wallet Settings](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1845) button is hidden when additional settings are available. { _minor, merge_ }
- Updated [Chinese translation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1871).
- Show an error when the user attempts to logout while having [active orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1904).
- Fixed the [accelerate order button](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1847) not hiding after the swap tx is mined.
- Added a [form](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1916) to delete archived records (orders and matches) from the client, with optional saving of deleted records in CSV files.
- Fixed multiple UI bugs on the [Markets page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1890).
- Fixed a case where clients could stay unaware that their [orders have been revoked](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1865) due to an upcoming market suspension.
- Fixed an error when creating an [external wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1913).

Internal and developer changes:

- Fixed recovery for [not connected wallets](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1891) and added support for recovering disabled wallets.
- Implemented foundations for DCR [fidelity bonds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1818): bond transaction structure, common interfaces to create/broadcast/refund bonds (for client), parsing and validation of bond tx (for server). Time-locked [fidelity bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_bond) will replace the current registration fee system. Bonds will be redeemable by the user who posted the bond after a certain time, to create an opportunity cost to use DCRDEX instead of a simple monetary cost. It also is a prerequisite for building a [server mesh](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1765). To make the transition smoother, the client and server retain all the legacy registration fee machinery, and the clients continue to use the legacy registration system for now.
- Moved hard-coded [tooltip strings](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1902) to translation files.
- Fixed [locktime check](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1907) { _minor, unreleased_ }
- Improved stability of [swap tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1737). { _merge with testing stuff_ }
- Improved stability of [wallet syncing tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1914). { _merge with testing stuff_ }
- Removed [duplicate translations](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1910). { _minor, merge with translations or general maintenance_ }
- Clarified how to [submit PRs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/7291243e4b02fbae99acbff4495def28da2367c1) in the contribution guide. { _merge with documentation_ }
- Added a check that [test names](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1926) are valid. { _minor, group with test improvements_ }
- Expire [request timeouts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1915) when WebSocket connection is closed, to avoid hangs on shutdown.
- Fixed [locked balance](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1918) calculation for ZEC. This required to implement a workaround for the wallet not unlocking spent coins automatically. Currently DOGE and ZEC require this quirk.
- Added [release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1899) for v0.5.3 and v0.5.4. { _minor, merge with documentation_ }
- Fixed and improved [simnet tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1909). Most tests will run twice, alternating the maker and taker between clients. This has helped to discover a few bugs.
- Fixed HTML template parsing for keys [containing dash](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1923) (welcome to DCRDEX, [@norwnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commits?author=norwnd)!). { _minor, group?_ }
- Fixed panic in [WebSocket](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1928) method for loading candles.

Ethereum support:

- Improved [ETH wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1893) connection management.
- Added [gas limits](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1894) in ETH and ETH token wallets so that at most 1/4 of the gas limit of a block can be filled up by a swap or redeem transaction. This should prevent some huge [unswappable orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1771).
- Implemented [RPC client](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1832) for communicating with an Ethereum node over WebSockets, HTTP or IPC connections.

- Added [ChangeNOW](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1093) exchange and direct DCR URLs for other instant exchanges that support them.
- Removed [mobile wallets](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1092) because they are no longer maintained.
- Updated all links and tags for [v1.7.5 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1091). 
- Added [category filters](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1090) to /news. This allows viewers to easily sort between Software Releases, Decred Journal, Press Releases, and General Coverage of Decred.
- Added DCRDEX v0.5 [Press Release](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1085).
- [Removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1084) "Decred in the Press" from footer.

October was a big month for crypto hacks and exploits, by the 13th there had [already](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/13/october-becomes-worst-month-for-crypto-hacks-with-two-weeks-to-go/) been 11 different DeFi attacks in which $718 million was obtained by hackers. One that stands out is Mango Markets, which was [hit](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/12/how-market-manipulation-led-to-a-100m-exploit-on-solana-defi-exchange-mango/) for a $100M exploit when a trader manipulated some prices to borrow all of the assets on the platform. One of the attackers [tweeted](https://twitter.com/avi_eisen/status/1581326197241180160) about a "highly profitable trading strategy" which they had engaged in, after a settlement had been negotiated with the platform which would allow other depositors to regain access to their funds. Another quirk of the story is that the attacker made a proposal to resolve the situation with no criminal charges and the [voted](https://twitter.com/alex_valaitis/status/1580017142132805632) for it with some of the tokens they obtained from the exploit.

Kim Kardashian has [settled](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/03/us-sec-charges-kim-kardashian-for-promoting-ethereummax/) with the SEC, agreeing to pay $1.26M over her undisclosed shilling of EthereumMax in 2021. SEC Chief Gary Gensler has been [promoting](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1576897535427448832) this as a big win.

Rune's "Endgame" proposal for Maker DAO has been approved, and it has been [noted](https://twitter.com/SebVentures/status/1584875892555268096) that the majority of delegated MKR voting for it is controlled by Rune.
