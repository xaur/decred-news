![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover text}")

{intro, major news of the month:

* 1.4
* Android 1.0
* DEX proposal
}

{something about covering the start of Feb}

## v1.4.0 Upgrade and Consensus Vote

Node and wallet software v1.4.0 was released. Full release notes and downloads are [on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.4.0). As always, make sure to [verify the downloads](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/verifying-binaries/).

The release brings significant improvements, along with a proposed change to the consensus rules which fixes a bug with the Lightning Network support. Node operators are advised to upgrade to help the network reach the upgrade threshold. Once upgraded, voters should set their [voting preferences](https://docs.decred.org/governance/how-to-vote/). Upgrade progress can be tracked at [voting.decred.org](https://voting.decred.org/).

For technical details of the consensus change see [DCP0004](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0004/dcp-0004.mediawiki) and a [post](https://matheusd.com/post/dcp0004-and-hardforks/) by @matheusd.

Except for the vote agenda, v1.4.0 final has no other significant changes since Release Candidate 2 which was covered in [December](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/201812.html).

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): An [issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1568) was discovered in v1.4.0 RC1. The large change to UTXO set semantics accidentally fixed a bug in consensus rules. Old incorrect behavior was [preserved](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1570) until a consensus vote can take place to correct it. Thanks to everybody who helped to discover and fix the bug in the release candidate.

The code for the consensus vote is [completed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1579) and included in the final [v1.4.0 release](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.4.0). The fix and vote was prioritized because it is required for Lightning Network. [DCP004](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0004/dcp-0004.mediawiki) (Decred Change Proposal) explains the change in detail and reminds of useful applications of relative locks beyond LN. Side effect of this work was [refactoring](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1583) and reinforcement of tests in that area. @matheusd has published a [blog post](https://matheusd.com/post/dcp0004-and-hardforks/) which gives an overview of the bug and how it was found and responded to.

Discussion [started](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1593) how to further improve stake difficulty algorithm by removing oscillations - this could make ticket price even more smooth.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): bug fixes and preparation for v1.4.0 release.

A feature to specify config options as command line arguments [merged](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1975) to master.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): Feature to view previous versions of a proposal was enabled.

In development: Onboarding popup was [replaced](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/986) with relevant links to docs. Thanks to lemonkabir for discovering a couple of [security](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/647) [issues](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/650). [Cache layer](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/660) entered review phase.

Discussions:

* Missing admin [feature](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/662) to censor public proposal was identified: there must be a way to remove a public proposal that was edited to include abusive content. Alternatively, admins would have to review all edits before they are shown on the proposals site.
* [Automated end-to-end testing](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/976) and [QA checklist](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/977) for major changes.
* Large frontend code [refactoring](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/990) to address complexity, performance and dev productivity issues. First proposed [solution](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/990#issuecomment-454535696) is to use GraphQL.

[dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): Final version 1.0 was released! Get it on Google Play Store for [mainnet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.mainnet) or [testnet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.testnet) wallets. Test coins can be obtained via the [faucet](http://faucet.decred.org/). Feedback is welcome [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/am7j40/decred_wallet_for_android_v10_released/) and bug reports [on GitHub](http://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues).

Since release candidate 2, final version added sync progress display, no wifi alert, new splash screen and minor bug fixes - full changelog [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/compare/v1.0.0-rc2...v1.0.0-rc3). Congrats dcrandroid team!

[dcrios](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): preview is [available](https://testflight.apple.com/join/dvq51tCh) on Apple TestFlight.

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): New home page design is [advancing](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/921). Values on the home page now [update automatically](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/961) when new block is found. Exchange rate monitoring was [added](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/951) to the backend that enables showing USD values on the UI. HTTPS is now enforced on `explorer` and `mainnet` subdomains ([discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$154818146313660CWvZy:decred.org)).

New home page design that includes exchange rate, new address table views, improved charts and speed optimizations are [available](https://twitter.com/decredexplorer/status/1093182831487053825) in v4 beta at [beta.dcrdata.org](https://beta.dcrdata.org/). Detailed release notes will be compiled with the release candidate.

Dev side: @buck54321 is [destroying](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/915) imperative jQuery code. Team is preparing stress testing of Insight API _(they call it torture testing, ouch)_.

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): Internal code improvements, preliminary work for Decrediton integration. A [monitoring page](https://mainnet-split-tickets.matheusd.com/) was set up that shows active splitting sessions from all VSPs that support it.

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): New pages: [Operating a VSP](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/operating-a-vsp/) outlines configuration requirements and desired skillset of VSP operators, [Solo PoS Voting](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/solo-proof-of-stake-voting/) brings the guide by @jz to all docs readers, [Address Details](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/address-details/) describes all possible types of addresses, [Contributing to Decred](https://docs.decred.org/contributing/contributing-to-decred/) explains how to become a paid Decred contractor.

Deep dive security discussion in #documentation concluded that it is possible to assemble general [computer security guidelines](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/101) that will be beneficial for the whole space.

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb): Huge effort to migrate the site to Hugo was [completed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/491) by @peter\_zen. Hugo is a static site generator written in Go that makes updating site content much easier. Several site speed [optimizations](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/513) were enabled. [voting.decred.org](https://voting.decred.org/) dashboard is being [updated](https://github.com/decred/hardforkdemo/commits/master) in preparation for the upcoming consensus vote - congrats @jholdstock with diving into Go!

Other:

* New [Bug Bounty](https://bounty.decred.org/) website is also built with Hugo. Code [repository](https://github.com/decred/dcrbounty) is open for bug reports and contributions.
* More terminology changes in dcrwallet, dcrdocs and dcrweb.
* Projects are gradually switching to a faster golangci-lint linter.
* More security headers [enabled](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/537) on decred.org.
* [SQL interface](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/agpkjv/sql_interface_to_live_onchain_decred_data/) to Decred on-chain data might be interesting to researchers.
* GitHub now [allows](https://github.blog/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/) private repositories with up to 3 collaborators for free accounts.

Dev activity stats for January: 242 active PRs, 243 master commits, 60K added and 47K deleted lines spread across 8 repositories. Contributions came from 2-8 developers per repository.

Congratulations to 6 new contributors [listed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/486) on decred.org:

* David Habibi (@eSizeDave, community manager - Australia)
* Elian Huesca (@elian, community manager - Mexico)
* Marcelo Martins (@mm, Community Manager - Portugal)
* Mariusz Szyma (@donmario, community manager - Poland)
* Morphy Tsai (@morphymore, community manager - Taiwan)
* Tomasz Porwit (@kozel, education and outreach)

4 inactive developers [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/528) from decred.org: Cruz Molina (@freethinkingaway, dcrdata), Huy Nguyen Tuan (@huyntsgs, dcrwallet), Macaulay Davies (@mcedward), Rohit Nagori.

Independent Decred contractors [published](https://medium.com/decred/decred-independent-contractor-roadmap-884faba3db39) their plans for 2019, thanks to ~15 people who contributed. The post triggered a [discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$15476119656176jVTYW:decred.org) about roadmaps, central planning and contractor autonomy, as well as commentary from Ditto.

## Governance

In January the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 16,776 DCR and spent 9,991 DCR. Using January's daily average DCR/USD rate of $17.1, this is $286K received and $170K spent. As these payments were for work completed in December, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the December average daily rate of $17.5 - in which case the USD received/spent figures are $294K/$175K.

Contractors are now [getting paid](https://docs.decred.org/contributing/contributor-compensation/) on ~15th of each month for the prior month's work. The delay between invoicing and getting paid was cut in half from ~30th day. Work is ongoing to further decrease this delay.

RFP: Decred Decentralized Exchange Infrastructure proposal was [submitted](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a) by @jy-p. It outlines motivation and high level design of the DEX first described in June [post](https://blog.decred.org/2018/06/05/A-New-Kind-of-DEX/). The project is estimated to complete in less than 6 months with a budget between USD 100,000 and USD 1,000,000. Voting will happen in 2 phases: first will determine if stakeholders want this at all, and second to choose a specific team, budget and detailed plan to go forward. This process is known as [request for proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_proposal).

Decred Bug Bounty program [launched](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1087486930093264897) following a successful [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d33a2667469b56942adf42453def6cc2292325251e4cf791e806939ea9efc9e1) vote in December. Check the rules on the new website [bounty.decred.org](https://bounty.decred.org/) and the intro blog post on [hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/decred-launches-debug-decred-bug-bounty-program-7e4d2af27ec9). Credits to @fernandoabolafio and @jholdstock for majority of the site work. Bounty team who decides on validity of submissions and payouts includes @degeri, @dnldd, @fernandoabolafio, @jholdstock and @matheusd. Congrats team with the launch!

@Dustorf is preparing proposals to improve transparency and increase stakeholder's control of the allocation of funds for the marketing activities. Events spending [pre-proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/anhh8n/proposal_to_get_events_spending_approved_via/) was published for feedback on Reddit after first iteration [in chat](https://matrix.to/#/!aNPTuiryMFmdMQWUzb:decred.org/$154896889724431Mxlvj:decred.org). Marketing budget pre-proposal also started [in chat](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154897255124536mFHoo:decred.org) and landed [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/aolr79/politeia_proposal_to_fund_marketing_ops_for_2019/) after a first round of feedback.

@oregonisaac is [looking](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$15474111512672Whvns:decred.org) for Java developers to evaluate requirements for ATM integration. Draft of the proposal was posted and discussed [in chat](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$154828004015153jWdiD:decred.org). There was some consensus to use 2-phase RFP voting. Another good point discussed was whether to wait for mobile apps releases before proceeding with the ATMs.

Discussions:

* Baeond proposal spurred a [discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$15468733339790vCEoH:decred.org) of an attack vector where stakeholders are offered an airdrop of some token in return for them approving a proposal.
* [Engagement](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$15481365491827928DiBLm:matrix.org) and satisfaction with Politeia so far.
* How [UX enhancements](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/678) can help voters to pre-emptively address bad proposals and stay vigilant.

## Network

Hashrate: January's hashrate opened at ~187 Ph/s and closed ~225 Ph/s, bottoming at 144 Ph/s and peaking at 312 Ph/s throughout the month. As of Feb 8, pool hashrate distribution: Poolin 29%, F2pool 26%, BTC.com 19%, UUPool 8%, Luxor 4%, CoinMine 1% and others are 13% per [dcrstats.com](https://dcrstats.com/pow). Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was 109.4 DCR (+6.4) on Feb 4 per dcrstats.com. The price varied between 101.5-111.6 DCR. Locked amount was 4.20-4.38 million DCR, which corresponded to 46.3-47.5% of the available supply.

There were 90 total split tickets in January. [Data](https://gist.github.com/oregonisaac/8eb4d50af9fa888c920666fb73ba44b2) since May 2018 shows steady growth.

Nodes: As of Feb 4 there were 197 public listening nodes and 369 normal nodes per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats). Version distribution: v1.5.0 dev builds: 4.3% (+2.8%), v1.4.0 dev and rc builds: 13% (+6%), v1.3.0: 55%, v1.2.0: 14% (-6%), v1.1.2: 8% (-2%), v1.1.0: 3% (-1%).

Always do your research _before_ using wallets or services, especially those that take custody of your funds.

## Adoption

BlueYard [announced](https://medium.com/@BlueYard/blueyard-2-3d0bbaf1f1b6) second fund raise and explained their strategy of investing into contrarian projects.

## Outreach

Marketing team is [planning](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$15468814029997AWtQJ:decred.org) to approach reporters publishing inaccuracies about Decred. As a test case for that workflow one horrible article was scrutinized by the community and Ditto collected the feedback for that and future cases. Ditto has [systems](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154690407510431bVTJQ:decred.org) to catch every piece of media written about Decred. As they get to know the community better, it will be possible to address inaccuracies in real time. Another issue discussed was integrating Ditto's [corrections workflow](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/71) with voluntary submissions from the community.

Tagline for Decred was extensively discussed [in #marketing](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154711632712869dqRko:decred.org) and [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/afctai/tagline_to_capture_the_decred_project/). Final version of messaging settled it on "Decred: Secure. Adaptable. Self-Funding." which gathered most support. As time goes this will be revised to adapt to the ever changing space.

January update from Ditto:

* Went through several iterations of the foundational messaging document with significant community input and received positive feedback on the [final version](https://pastebin.com/E5L6u2RV). (discussions: [second](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154706728112462ubmNo:decred.org) version, [final](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154880432321730DYSYl:decred.org) version)
* Worked with the community to source commentary on 51% attacks for future use with reporters when another attack inevitably happens - the goal being to get Decred's message in front of journalists even when it doesn't have any hard news to share.
* Media trained three Decred members.
* Secured media coverage: [feature article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/leslieankney/2019/01/11/who-should-hold-power-decred-governance-and-what-it-means-for-investors/) in Forbes ([report](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$1547232200845NiZnO:decred.org)), [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUxDxJ4YAUA) with Joshua for Bitsonline, commentary by @richardred on the delay in Ethereum's hard fork in [Breaker Mag](https://breakermag.com/what-we-know-about-the-vulnerability-behind-ethereums-rollback-of-constantinople/) and [Crypto Briefing](https://cryptobriefing.com/scaling-delay-ethereum-constantinople/).
* Drafted an announcement of the bug bounty program and [placed](https://hackernoon.com/decred-launches-debug-decred-bug-bounty-program-7e4d2af27ec9) it in Hacker Noon - thereby reaching a much broader pool of developers, compared to Decred's own channels.
* Facilitated two interviews that are pending media coverage.
* Flew down to the North American Bitcoin Conference, where Ditto facilitated interviews between Decred and reporters (Cheddar TV, Altcoin Buzz, etc.) and spent quality time with the team.
* Worked closely with Dustin on an events plan that encompasses both events Decred wants to speak at and events it wants to have a booth at.
* Submitted an application for Jake to speak at Consensus 2019.
* Worked closely with Dustin on a marketing and communications plan for the first half of 2019, spanning messaging, media training, media relations, events and speaking, and strategy. This plan is still pending.

Individuals are advised to share media coverage because amplification is just as important as the media placement itself.

For even more detail see the biweekly updates on [Jan 7](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154688457110052CiWYd:decred.org) and [Jan 18](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$15478384869864RTCsv:decred.org). Nice discovery in one of them:

> The community welcomes and encourages questions, even if the person asking fears that their questions are "stupid." We've observed a spirit of collaboration and willingness to help that we haven't seen in other communities. It's refreshing!

Other:

* It is [rumored](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$15478503329998HCAzR:decred.org) that Ditto can arrange a mad beard that entitles one to wear Silver Decred Jacket.
* @anshawblack [dropped](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154792069410439nSRtR:decred.org) Decred merch in all record stores of Miami.
* Decredible shop was [renewed](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/ae07as/custom_decred_merch_with_19_discount_in_the/) with extra items and new Decred logos. All products can be personalized and tweaked.

Urgent Notice: new batch of Stakey plushies is [available](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/ahalex/new_batch_of_stakey_plushies_available/)!

## Events

Attended:

* [The North American Bitcoin Conference](https://btcmiami.com/) in Miami, USA. Attendance was surprisingly low: 6K people were expected but only 1.8K were claimed after the event. @jy-p's presentation [Applications of Blockchain Time-Stamping](https://btcmiami.com/session/applications-of-blockchain-time-stamping/) was well done and well attended given the overall numbers. 3 members went through media training and found it useful, 7 more are scheduled. Store of value, "Secure. Adaptable. Self-Funding.", and the accompanying messaging was found to be a very effective way of talking about Decred. It was found to be most clear and impactful. Full report with links to photos and videos [here](https://github.com/heyvj/decred-events/blob/master/reports/20190116-tnabc-miami.md).
* [OKEx Global Meetup Tour](https://www.eventbrite.hk/e/okex-global-meetup-tour-2019-taiwan-tickets-54689867867) in Taipei, Taiwan. @morphymore told the story of Decred and how it works. "Compared to 2018, people are starting to recognize Decred better. A few people told me that they know about Decred from the Chinese translation I did last year of the Placeholder's Investment Thesis. It was very encouraging and shows that the Decred awareness in Taiwan is indeed growing." ([report](https://matrix.to/#/!aNPTuiryMFmdMQWUzb:decred.org/$15478245399446fDEQa:decred.org), [photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/rXd9PeYmyAGrVTQN7))
* [10 lat Bitcoina](https://10latbitcoina.com.pl/) in Warsaw, Poland. @karamble talked about longevity in cryptocurrencies on the basis of Decred. The team of 4 people established relations with several crypto outlets and engaged with a few businesses. BitHub.pl noted: "The Decred boys were intensely engaged in answering questions of those interested displaying tons of patience at that, since the questions poured in basically all the time!". ([report](https://github.com/heyvj/decred-events/blob/master/reports/20190126-10LatBitcoina-Warsaw.md))

[Decred page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decred) on Wikipedia was deleted. On Jan 8 a user [removed](https://archive.today/ApV3P) a bunch of "bad sources" and on Jan 10 vandalized the page by removing a large and important part of content. Just 4 hours later another user nominated Decred page for deletion - the [3rd attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Decred_%283rd_nomination%29) to take it down. For background, the author of [2nd nomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Decred_%282nd_nomination%29) for deletion had interesting [views](https://archive.today/QAlRp) on notability and was [banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Prince_of_Thieves) as a sockpuppet. On Jan 11 content removal was reverted and its author was banned as sockpuppet, but next day the removal was [applied again](https://archive.today/fZUHW) by another user without much commentary. After the slicing the page became very small and all reviewers [voted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Decred_%283rd_nomination%29) to delete it due to lack of reputable sources. All suggested recent articles in major crypto media were deemed [not good enough](https://archive.today/4xwaN) references. On Jan 18 the page was deleted and removed from [List of cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies) that was left with more notable coins. Details and links to discussions are captured in [this issue](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/79). Experienced Wikipedia editors are welcome to help.

[Criticism](https://twitter.com/tonevays/status/1086702239853379584) from Bitcoin maximalists triggered a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/ahuawl/decred_launch_security_laws/) on how Decred looks in context of securities laws. One vector critics use is that Decred's premine and airdrop was not fair and "hand selected". This is a misrepresentation of the (huge) manual effort to filter out airdrop cheaters, per [this discussion]( https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154810656412322VrQLg:decred.org) that also has many useful links describing Decred's launch. One interesting insight shared is that ~300K (35%) airdropped coins never moved. Another related [chat](https://matrix.to/#/!kdpEDksmOMNrlMqffD:decred.org/$15467943549316LjeYZ:decred.org) was about Twitter attacks claiming how Decred's initial distribution was not transparent or fair, while avoiding inconvenient facts about Bitcoin's early mining and Satoshi's million BTC. Finally, a [history lesson](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$15467944729319gvTvt:decred.org) explained early days of staking and made a point that original devs had no unilateral control of consensus rules from day 1.

Huge debate about importance of building Reddit community [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/aib2x3/noah_pierau_on_blockchain_governance_decred/).

## Markets

In January DCR was trading between USD 15.5-19.5 / BTC 0.00435-0.00487. The average daily rate was $17.1.

## Relevant External

Ethereum Classic (ETC) was subject to a 51% attack, with the alert being raised by [CoinNess](https://www.coinness.com/news/198264) on Jan 7. Coinbase then [announced](https://blog.coinbase.com/ethereum-classic-etc-is-currently-being-51-attacked-33be13ce32de) that it had detected a deep reorganization of the ETC chain and had halted ETC transactions. The article lists a number of reorgs that involved double spends, putting the total amount involved at $1.1 million, across 15 distinct reorg events. Coinbase was not itself a target for these attacks. The Gate.io exchange subsequently [announced](https://www.gate.io/article/16735) that it had been targeted and had lost around $200K, and that it would absorb the loss. Gate.io also significantly increased the number of confirmations required for ETC deposits. In an unusual development, the attacker then [returned](https://www.gate.io/article/16740) $100K of the ETC to Gate.io, they have tried but failed to make contact with the attacker and do not know the reason for the return of funds. Other victims of the ETC double spends have not come forward. 

Ethereum's developers [decided](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-developers-give-tentative-greenlight-to-asic-blocking-code) (tentatively) on Jan 4 to go ahead with a change of mining algorithm from Ethash to ProgPoW. This move is intended to stop ASICs from mining Ethereum. The Block [outlined](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/01/11/despite-core-dev-consensus-proposition-progpow-faces-community-concerns/) concerns like reduced attack cost after the switch, weaker incentives of GPU miners, questionable benefit of transfer of power from Bitmain and Innosilicon to AMD and Nvidia, and a possible chain split. They concluded that the debate around the algorithm switch will be a good test for Ethereum's governance process.

Ethereum developers also [delayed](https://breakermag.com/what-we-know-about-the-vulnerability-behind-ethereums-rollback-of-constantinople/) the Constantinople hard fork on Jan 15 after a security vulnerability which would have enabled a "reentrancy attack" was [detected](https://medium.com/chainsecurity/constantinople-enables-new-reentrancy-attack-ace4088297d9). 

Fundamentals of Proof of Work [article](https://blog.sia.tech/fundamentals-of-proof-of-work-beaa68093d2b) by David Vorick makes the case for exclusive hardware cryptocurrencies and contrasts them with shared hardware cryptocurrencies that suffer from multiple issues, especially those pursuing ASIC resistance. One of the issues with non specialized hardware is that the hardware's value is not closely related to the asset (because it can mine many other chains). Another issue is hashrate marketplaces, they allow hardware owners to get more profit by not caring about which coin they mine, even if the hashrate is rented to attackers. Decred benefits from specialized hardware and is by far the dominant coin for its algorithm (Blake256r14). Although this hardware cannot be considered "exclusive" to Decred, in addition to current hashrate dominance for its algorithm Decred has the PoS factor which is capable of denying rewards to misbehaving miners.

The first round of Aragon proposal voting [concluded](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-aragon-network-vote-1/) on Jan 26. Of the 12 submitted proposals, 3 were excluded from the vote by the Aragon Foundation (1 because of lack of full time leadership and engineering talent, 2 were excluded to reduce cognitive load on voters). 8 of the 9 proposals voted on were [approved](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/governance.aragonproject.eth/0x277bfcf7c2e162cb1ac3e9ae228a3132a75f83d4) by ANT holders, with one proposal (to change the voting period duration from 48 hours to 1 week) rejected. ANT participation rates [ranged](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/governance.aragonproject.eth/0x277bfcf7c2e162cb1ac3e9ae228a3132a75f83d4) from 2.3 to 7.8%. The most expensive [proposal](https://github.com/aragon/flock/blob/master/teams/Aragon%20One/2019.md) to be approved will pay Aragon One $4 million for 2019 operating costs plus an incentive package consisting of 1.675 million ANT on a 5 year vesting schedule. An incentive in ANT with a vesting schedule was included as part of most proposals, in addition to the main cost to be paid in DAI. In total this round of approved proposals will cost around $5.94 million + 2.52 million ANT (~$880K).

The EOS referendum system for constitutional amendments went [live](https://medium.com/@eosnationbp/the-fate-of-eos-is-in-the-hands-of-token-holders-3d345147ef6) on Jan 11. So far 77 proposals have been [submitted](https://bloks.io/vote/referendums). The voting period for these proposals is flexible and specified by the submitter, some last as long as four months. The proposals with the most votes (as of Jan 31) have votes from around 2% of circulating EOS, but most proposals have very low participation (only 10 have greater than 0.5% participation). So far the most popular proposals are to [change](https://bloks.io/vote/referendums/rex4all) where the fees for short names and RAM purchases go, [delete](https://bloks.io/vote/referendums/decaf) the EOS Core Arbitration Forum, and [burn](https://bloks.io/vote/referendums/burnsaving) the inflation funds in eosio.saving (to be used for funding the worker proposal system).

The NEM Foundation [announced](https://forum.nem.io/t/nem-foundation-message-to-the-community/21753) that it is in financial difficulty and needs to downsize its workforce. A new council took over the foundation on Jan 1 and when they opened the books they saw a problem. The previous council had a burn rate of 9 million XEM per month ($360K now, considerably more at the time) which was spent by independent regional entities on promotional activities with little accountability. This was deemed not sustainable, and the new council has restructured the foundation and is presently seeking additional funds.

Updated version of the "forkonomy" research by Wassim Alsindi (@parallelind) was [published](https://hackernoon.com/towards-an-analytical-discipline-of-forkonomy-summer-2018-e6da993ee3f9) along with an up-to-date [follow-up](https://medium.com/@parallelind/forkonomy-revisited-where-are-they-now-73fbfbec6b4d).

Hcash forked a few [more](https://archive.today/rEhWX) Decred projects: [Autonomy](https://archive.today/KTCdX) (Politeia), [hcexplorer](https://archive.today/2KTtW) and [hctime](https://archive.today/K151A). In Politeia, they accidentally [removed](https://archive.today/ECplt) copyright of Decred developers and forgot to rename the project. After being notified they quickly reacted by removing multiple repositories, [reinstating](https://github.com/TKFORKED/autonomy/commit/4b05c2c31829df64be69e546d939a563247e1927) the license and [renaming](https://github.com/TKFORKED/autonomy/commit/98d5f63f676e45e6a91eba99da3db985effdb1f2) the Politeia fork to Autonomy. A few [missed](https://twitter.com/michae2xl/status/1084270468234915840) subtle Decred icons were fixed. Some [projects](https://archive.today/https://github.com/HcashOrg/hc*) were forked with their commit history erased and without marking them as forks on GitHub. Complaints ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/hcash/comments/adwmx2/hcash_being_shady_again/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/hcash/comments/afepsc/hcash_cant_be_bothered_to_change_the_decred_logo/)) on their subreddit were silently [censored](https://archive.today/Edy7T) with no reply. Oh, and [r/hcash](https://archive.today/Edy7T) styles look [familiar](https://archive.today/e1rAw). Discussed [here](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$154696507010921TRgid:decred.org).

A [sad example](https://twitter.com/BrianDColwell/status/1090286752831434752) of what can happen when the team runs out of money.

ICO projects [withdrew](https://diar.co/ethereum-ico-treasury-balances/) ~441K ETH ($52.5M as of Feb 9) from treasuries in December 2018.

[Staked](https://staked.us/about/), a startup that provides staking services for institutional investors, raised $4.5M from Pantera, Coinbase, DCG and others. Covered by [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/pantera-coinbase-join-4-5-million-round-in-staking-as-a-service-startup), [The Block](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/01/31/winklevoss-twins-pantera-get-behind-a-new-business-thats-capitalizing-on-a-new-trend-sweeping-crypto-hedge-funds/) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-01/some-crypto-investors-are-playing-it-safe-after-volatile-run). Staked operates a Decred [VSP](https://decred.staked.us/) since Nov 2018.

Binance now [allows](https://support.binance.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022498052) one to buy crypto with Visa and MasterCard (and the list of [restrictions](https://support.binance.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022204152) tells us something about fiat).

Coinbase [banned](https://cryptocoinspy.com/coinbase-bans-gab-again/) accounts of social media platform Gab. This is [not the first](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/coinbase-suspends-wikileaks-bitcoin-account.html) big case of account suspension by the exchange.

Medium [censored](https://bitcoinist.com/how-to-use-bitcoin-anonymously-ban-medium/) an article "How to use Bitcoin anonymously" which spurred discussion and an [issue](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/70) about migrating away from it, or at least treating it as one of multiple content mirrors. Backup your Medium posts, just in case.

Bank for International Settlements released a very optimistic [study](https://www.bis.org/publ/work765.htm) of cryptocurrencies.

[Vulnerability](https://cryptoslate.com/researchers-discover-vulnerability-bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-digital-signatures/) was discovered in digital signatures of Bitcoin and a few other systems. A tiny set of signatures was generated using an incorrect implementation of signature algorithm which can be used to reveal private keys. Only a few thousand signatures were vulnerable out of nearly a billion Bitcoin signatures examined. According to researchers, the vast majority of cryptocurrency users need not worry.

Largest [data breach](https://www.troyhunt.com/the-773-million-record-collection-1-data-reach/) in history contains a collection of thousands of hacked databases. Choose wisely who you share data with.

Cryptopia was [hacked](https://www.investinblockchain.com/cryptopia-hack-estimated-16-million-lost/) with loss estimates varying between $3-16 million. Binance [froze](https://www.investinblockchain.com/binance-freezes-funds-cryptopia-hack/) some funds coming from the hack.

New wave of hAnt infections (first seen in August) was [reported](https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-ransomware-strain-is-locking-up-bitcoin-mining-rigs-in-china/) targeting Bitcoin mining rigs. The ransomware demands to infect 1,000 other devices or pay 10 BTC, else it threatens to burn the rig. There have been no reports of destroyed equipment so far.

Resource exhaustion vulnerability known as Fake Stake attack was [discovered](https://medium.com/@dsl_uiuc/fake-stake-attacks-on-chain-based-proof-of-stake-cryptocurrencies-b8b05723f806) in 26+ blockchains based on PoSv3, the majority of them deployed mitigations. Part of the root cause is that in many such systems the Proof of Stake layer was "grafted in" to the Bitcoin Core codebase insecurely. One of report's authors tweeted that Decred is [not affected](https://twitter.com/Sanket1729/status/1087829688347701254).
