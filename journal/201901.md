{introduction, major news of the month}

## Development

{per-project summary, drop items without updates}

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

An issue was discovered during the testing of RC1: the change to reverse UTXO set semantics accidently corrected wrong behavior in consensus rules. Old incorrect behavior was [preserved](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1570) until a consensus vote can take place to fix it. {comment on impact} The code for the consensus vote is [completed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1579) and will be included in the final v1.4 release. The fix and vote was prioritized because it is necessary for Lightning Network.

@oregonisaac {@isaac?} is [looking](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$15474111512672Whvns:decred.org) for Java developers to evaluate requirements for ATM integration. Draft of the RPF document was posted and discussed here https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$154828004015153jWdiD:decred.org , there is some concensus to use 2-phase voting: first vote to see if stakeholders want ATMs at all, and second to chose a specific implementation. Another good point discussed was whether to wait for mobile apps releases before proceeding with the ATMs.

Discussions:

* attack vector: offer to airdrop some token to stakeholders in return for funding a proposal https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$15468733339790vCEoH:decred.org

## Outreach

{overview of outreach/communications/marketing activity for past month and any short-term plans}

Ditto's Bi-Weekly Update https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154688457110052CiWYd:decred.org , one thing they learned that week was:

> The community welcomes and encourages questions, even if the person asking fears that their questions are "stupid." We've observed a spirit of collaboration and willingness to help that we haven't seen in other communities. It's refreshing!

Ditto has set up a system to catch every piece of media written about Decred and to address inaccuracies in real time. As a test case for that workflow one horrible article was scrutinized by the community and Ditto collected the feedback for that and future cases. Another issue discussed was integrating Ditto's workflow with voluntary submissions from the community. https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$15468814029997AWtQJ:decred.org

Ditto shared a second version of the Foundational Messaging document https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154706728112462ubmNo:decred.org
https://docs.google.com/document/d/19r9SjOWin4Fb9E2_90S7mdsG0BNxRBSYzsJjSYK2Jjw/edit

[Final version](https://pastebin.com/E5L6u2RV) of the document was [shared](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154880432321730DYSYl:decred.org) at the end of Jan.

Tagline for Decred was extensively discussed [in #marketing](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154711632712869dqRko:decred.org) and [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/afctai/tagline_to_capture_the_decred_project/).

On Jan 11 Ditto [reported](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$1547232200845NiZnO:decred.org) about the Forbes article and advised individuals to share it because amplification is just as important as the media placement itself.

Example of "thought leadership" placement can be seen the [comment here](https://cryptobriefing.com/scaling-delay-ethereum-constantinople/) by @richardred. {keep? reword?} In the following [discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$15476630757260cGbJc:decred.org) of it an issue was raised that Decred and Ethereum have very different backgrounds and this must be taken into account.

## Media

[blog.dcrclub.org](https://blog.dcrclub.org/) is a new website in Chinese that collects various articles and translations in one place. The source hosted [on GitHub](https://github.com/0x5826/blog.dcrclub.org) makes it easy to contribute or mirror the website on other domain for more resiliency. Credits to @TogT4V (Telegram) for starting the site.

@butterfly published some articles about Decred in [Arabic blog](https://decred-arabia.blogspot.com/2019/01/blog-post.html).

[Decred page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decred) on Wikipedia is under attack again. On Jan 8 user R2d232h2 [removed](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Decred&diff=prev&oldid=877407037) a bunch of "bad sources". On Jan 10 the same user [vandalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Decred&diff=next&oldid=877407037) the page by removing a large and important part of content. Just 4 hours later another user nominated Decred page for deletion - the [3rd attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Decred_%283rd_nomination%29) to take it down. On Jan 11 the second purge was reverted and R2d232h2 was banned as sockpuppet, but next day the removal was applied again. As it stands after the cutting, the page is very small and has all [votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Decred_%283rd_nomination%29) to delete it. All suggested recent articles in major crypto media are [not good enough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Decred#Request_edit_on_12_January_2019) references. For background, the author of [2nd nomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Decred_%282nd_nomination%29) for deletion had interesting [views](https://archive.today/QAlRp) on notability of articles and was [banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Prince_of_Thieves) as a sockpuppet. Extensively discussed [in #marketing](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$1547202592212vKSyw:decred.org) ([continued](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$15472392171087ucpIb:decred.org)), including possilble solutions. On Jan 18 the page was deleted and removed from List of cryptocurrencies that contains more notable entries. More details are captured in [this issue](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/79).

The good news, is it [can mean](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$15474897963391hhDDU:decred.org) Decred is moving in the right direction.

More [criticism](https://twitter.com/tonevays/status/1086702239853379584) from Bitcoin maximalists triggered a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/ahuawl/decred_launch_security_laws/) on how Decred looks in context of securities laws. One vector critics use is that Decred's premine and airdrop was not fair and "hand selected". This is a misrepresentation of the (huge) manual effort to filter out airdrop cheaters, per [this discussion]( https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154810656412322VrQLg:decred.org) that also has many useful links describing Decred's launch. One interesting insight shared there is that ~300k (35%) airdropped coins never moved. Another related [chat](https://matrix.to/#/!kdpEDksmOMNrlMqffD:decred.org/$15467943549316LjeYZ:decred.org) was about Twitter attacks claiming how Decred's initial distribution was not transparent or fair, while avoiding inconvenient facts about Bitcoin's early mining. Finally, this [history lesson](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$15467944729319gvTvt:decred.org) explained early days of staking and made a point that original devs had no unilateral control of consensus rules from day 1.

## Relevant External

{PoW, ASIC resistance, tech}

Ethereum Classic (ETC) was subject to a 51% attack, with the alert being raised by [CoinNess](https://www.coinness.com/news/198264) on Jan 7.  Coinbase then [announced](https://blog.coinbase.com/ethereum-classic-etc-is-currently-being-51-attacked-33be13ce32de) that it had detected a deep reorganization of the ETC chain and had halted ETC transactions. The article lists a number of reorgs that involved double spends, putting the total amount involved at $1.1 million, across 15 distinct reorg events. Coinbase was not itself a target for these attacks. The Gate.io exchange subsequently [announced](https://www.gate.io/article/16735) that it had been targeted and had lost around $200k, and that it would absorb the loss. Gate.io also significantly increased the number of confirmations required for ETC deposits. In an unusual development, the attacker then [returned](https://www.gate.io/article/16740) $100k of the ETC to gate.io, they have tried but failed to make contact with the attacker and do not know the reason for the return of funds. Other victims of the ETC double spends have not come forward. 

Ethereum's developers [decided](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-developers-give-tentative-greenlight-to-asic-blocking-code) (tentatively)  on Jan 4 to go ahead with a change of mining algorithm from Ethash to ProgPoW. This move is intended to stop ASICs from mining Ethereum.

Ethereum developers also [delayed](https://breakermag.com/what-we-know-about-the-vulnerability-behind-ethereums-rollback-of-constantinople/) the Constantinople hard fork on Jan 15 after a security vulnerability which would have enabled a "reentrancy attack" was [detected](https://medium.com/chainsecurity/constantinople-enables-new-reentrancy-attack-ace4088297d9). 

Fundamentals of Proof of Work [article](https://blog.sia.tech/fundamentals-of-proof-of-work-beaa68093d2b) by David Vorick makes the case for exclusive hardware cryptocurrencies and contrasts them with shared hardware cryptocurrencies that suffer from multiple issues, especially ASIC-resistant ones. One of the issues with non specialized hardware is hashrate marketplaces. They allow hardware owners to better profit from their hardware by not caring about which coin they mine, even if the hashrate is rented to attackers. Decred benefits from specialized hardware but is not "exclusive" to it, other coins exist or may appear in future that use the same mining algorithm. What protects Decred is the (current) hashrate dominance for its algorithm and the ability to strip mining rewards from the blocks.

The first round of Aragon proposal voting [concluded](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-aragon-network-vote-1/) on Jan 26. Of the 12 submitted proposals, 3 were excluded from the vote by the Aragon Foundation (1 because of lack of full time leadership and engineering talent, 2 were excluded to reduce cognitive load on voters). 8 of the 9 proposals voted on were [approved](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/governance.aragonproject.eth/0x277bfcf7c2e162cb1ac3e9ae228a3132a75f83d4) by ANT holders, with one proposal (to change the voting period duration from 48 hours to 1 week) rejected. ANT participation rates [ranged](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/governance.aragonproject.eth/0x277bfcf7c2e162cb1ac3e9ae228a3132a75f83d4) from 2.3 to 7.8%. The most expensive [proposal](https://github.com/aragon/flock/blob/master/teams/Aragon%20One/2019.md) to be approved will pay Aragon One $4 million for 2019 operating costs plus an incentive package consisting of 1.675 million ANT on a 5 year vesting schedule. An incentive in ANT with a vesting schedule was included as part of most proposals, in addition to the main cost to be paid in DAI. In total this round of approved proposals will cost around $5.94 million + 2.52 million ANT (~$880k).

The EOS referendum system for constitutional amendments went [live](https://medium.com/@eosnationbp/the-fate-of-eos-is-in-the-hands-of-token-holders-3d345147ef6) on Jan 11. So far 77 proposals have been [submitted](https://bloks.io/vote/referendums). The voting period for these proposals is flexible and specified by the submitter, some last as long as four months. The proposals with the most votes (as of Jan 31) have votes from around 2% of circulating EOS, but most proposals have very low participation (only 10 have greater than 0.5% participation). So far the most popular proposals are to [change](https://bloks.io/vote/referendums/rex4all) where the fees for short names and RAM purchases go, [delete](https://bloks.io/vote/referendums/decaf) the EOS Core Arbitration Forum, and [burn](https://bloks.io/vote/referendums/burnsaving) the inflation funds in eosio.saving (to be used for funding the worker proposal system).

The NEM Foundation [announced](https://forum.nem.io/t/nem-foundation-message-to-the-community/21753) that it is in financial difficulty and needs to downsize its workforce. A new council took over the foundation on January 1 and when they opened the books they saw a problem. The previous council had a burn rate of 9 million XEM per month ($360k now, considerably more at the time) which was spent by independent regional entities on promotional activities with little accountability. This was deemed not sustainable, and the new council has restructured the foundation and is presently seeking additional funds.

Updated version of the "forkonomy" research by Wassim Alsindi (@parallelind) was [published](https://hackernoon.com/towards-an-analytical-discipline-of-forkonomy-summer-2018-e6da993ee3f9) along with an up-to-date [follow-up](https://medium.com/@parallelind/forkonomy-revisited-where-are-they-now-73fbfbec6b4d).

Hcash forked a few [more](https://archive.today/rEhWX) Decred projects: [Autonomy](https://archive.today/KTCdX) (Politeia), [hcexplorer](https://archive.today/2KTtW) and [hctime](https://archive.today/K151A). In Politeia, they accidently [removed](https://archive.today/ECplt) copyright of Decred developers and forgot to rename the project. After being notified they quickly reacted by removing multiple repositories from TKFORKED account,  [reinstating](https://github.com/TKFORKED/autonomy/commit/4b05c2c31829df64be69e546d939a563247e1927) the license and [renaming](https://github.com/TKFORKED/autonomy/commit/98d5f63f676e45e6a91eba99da3db985effdb1f2) the Politeia fork to Autonomy. A few [missed](https://twitter.com/michae2xl/status/1084270468234915840) subtle Decred icons were fixed. Some [projects](https://archive.today/https://github.com/HcashOrg/hc*) were forked with their commit history erased and without marking them as forks on GitHub. Complaints on their subreddit were silently censored without reply ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/hcash/comments/adwmx2/hcash_being_shady_again/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/hcash/comments/afepsc/hcash_cant_be_bothered_to_change_the_decred_logo/).

Resource exhaustion vulnerability was [discovered](https://medium.com/@dsl_uiuc/fake-stake-attacks-on-chain-based-proof-of-stake-cryptocurrencies-b8b05723f806) 26+ currencies based on PoSv3, majority of them deployed mitigations. Part of the root cause is that in many such systems the Proof of Stake layer was "grafted in" Bitcoin Core codebase insecurely.
