Highlights for October:

- Release candidates of core software v1.5 are ready for testing. The major changes include a consensus rules change to add block header commitments that was funded by stakeholders in June and an overhaul of the mining infrastructure (dcrd), initial privacy implementation (dcrwallet), experimental LN integration and UI tweaks (Decrediton) and porting a huge set of upstream updates (dcrlnd).
- i2 Trading has started providing liquidity on 3 exchanges (4 pairs), following on from their successful proposal.
- Politeia's redesigned frontend is live. Check it out for a new aesthetic that's more in line with other Decred software, and performance improvements.
- October was a big month for events with a Decred presence, all around the world local community members are representing Decred at events they organize and attend.
- October also saw major publications from all three active research programs and the fourth which was approved in early November. There were also a number of articles and other media released about the first year of Politeia (anniversary was Oct 16).

## Prepare for the Upcoming Consensus Vote!

A vote to change consensus rules is coming in v1.5. Release candidate binaries are [available](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.5.0-rc1) now and final release will follow.

Please prepare for the vote by upgrading software and setting a vote choice for your solo or VSP tickets.

You can track the progress at dcrdata's [Agendas](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/agendas) page and at [voting.decred.org](https://voting.decred.org/).

High voter engagement sends a strong signal. Let's do it!

## v1.5 Release Candidates

Release candidates of dcrd, dcrwallet, Decrediton and dcrlnd are available for testing. Below are highlights from their release notes.

**dcrd v1.5**

Block header commitments are implemented and ready for activation pending successful on-chain vote. After upgrading to v1.5, stakeholders may set their vote preferences through their wallet or Voting Service Provider's (VSP) website. The primary goal of this change is to increase the security and efficiency of lightweight clients, such as Decrediton in its SPV mode and the dcrandroid/dcrios mobile wallets. It will also add infrastructure that paves the way for several future scalability enhancements. A high-level overview of the changes can be found in the [Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/0a1ff846ec271184ea4e3a921a3ccd8d478f69948b984445ee1852f272d54c58) that funded the work.

New block filters have been implemented. These filters, used by lightweight clients such as SPV wallets, have been updated to improve their efficiency, ergonomics, and include additional information such as the full ticket commitment script. The new block filters are version 2. The older version 1 filters are now deprecated and scheduled to be removed in the next release, so consumers should update to the new filters as soon as possible. Note that there is a one-time database update to build and store the new filters for all existing historical blocks which will likely take a while to complete (typically around 8 to 10 minutes on HDDs and 4 to 5 minutes on SSDs).

The mining infrastructure for building block templates and delivering the work to miners has been significantly overhauled. Improvements include support for asynchronous background template generation with intelligent vote propagation handling, improved handling of chain reorganizations necessary when the current tip is unable to obtain enough votes, better current state synchronization, near elimination of stale templates when new blocks and votes are received and subscriptions for streaming template updates. The standard [getwork RPC](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getwork) that PoW miners currently use to perform the mining process has been updated to make use of this new infrastructure, so existing PoW miners will seamlessly get the vast majority of benefits without requiring any updates. In addition, a new [notifywork RPC](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#notifywork) is now available that allows miners to register for work to be delivered asynchronously as it becomes available via a WebSockets [work notification](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#work). These notifications include the same information that getwork provides along with an additional reason parameter. This parameter allows the miners to make better decisions about when they should instruct workers to discard the current template immediately or should be allowed to finish their current round before being provided with the new template.

Miners are encouraged to update their software to make use of the new asynchronous notification infrastructure since it is more robust, efficient, and faster than polling getwork to manually determine the aforementioned conditions. **NOTE:** Miners that are not rolling the timestamp field as they mine should ensure their software is upgraded to roll the timestamp to the latest timestamp each time they hand work out to a miner. This helps ensure the block timestamps are as accurate as possible. Making use of notifications and rolling the timestamp has been implemented in [dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool).

Transaction script validation has been almost completely rewritten to significantly improve its speed and reduce the number of memory allocations. This introduces notable benefits, including 20-25% faster initial sync processing, quicker vote casting (which helps reduce the number of missed votes), and quicker block propagation.

Automatic external IP address discovery now allows full nodes to more easily discover other nodes on the network in a decentralized fashion. This will automate previously manual configuration steps such as setting the external IP address on the CLI, configuring the firewall and/or router for inbound connections and forwarding the port to the internal IP address running dcrd.

Tor IPv6 Support added. It is now possible to resolve and connect to IPv6 peers over Tor in addition to the existing IPv4 support.

**dcrwallet v1.5**

Major feature of this release is initial [CoinShuffle++](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1541) implementation that allows to purchase tickets from a collective mixed CoinJoin transaction. Protecting individual stakeholder's privacy is crucial because it also improves security of the network. Initial version has a number of limitations, most notably lack of support for VSP tickets, no graphical UI and reliance on central server for coordination. These will be addressed in future versions. It is worth noting that the server cannot know which outputs belong to which peer, in contrast with older CoinJoin designs.

Other features include voting agenda for block header commitments consensus change, the ability to [import](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1471) arbitrary extended pubkeys (important step towards removing address reuse), a flag to prevent the wallet from upgrading the coin type, a number of helpful RPC methods, improved performance and multiple bug fixes.

**Decrediton v1.5**

Main features of the release include initial Lightning Network integration, window size responsiveness for most pages, updated dark mode, a ton of UI tweaks, a fix of [excessive data download](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2166) and other bug fixes.

**dcrlnd v0.2**

Upstream changes were [ported](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/42) up to lnd [v0.8.0-beta](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.8.0-beta). A total of 379 commits and 90 PRs were merged. This has brought features like Safu Commitments, Watchtowers and Hodl invoices (_seriously, these are official terms_). Decred-specific work has been done to enable more seamless integration of dcrlnd in Decrediton.

Hashing algorithm to compute payment hashes has been [switched](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/46) from the initial BLAKE-256 back to the original SHA-256. This allows for cross-chain payments across the BTC/DCR/LTC LNs. This is a **breaking change**. Payments across channels made between nodes running v0.1 and v0.2 will NOT work and will cause an automatic forced channel closure. As the number of nodes is still small, this is not expected to cause a significant disturbance.

Remote wallets are now [usable](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/40); this allows users to run dcrlnd by connecting it to an existing remote dcrwallet instead of running an embedded one. This is what LN in Decrediton will use instead of requiring users to manually specify credentials.

See the [v1.5 RC1 release page](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.5.0-rc1) for details and downloads for all 4 projects. As always, [verify the binaries](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/verifying-binaries/). It is an extra hurdle, but it is the best way to ensure the files have not been altered.

Testing help is greatly appreciated to fix any possible bugs before the final release. Please report any issues you find in the release candidates.

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): RIPEMD-160 hash algorithm implementation was [imported](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1907) in the dcrd repository, motivated by its deprecation in `x/crypto` and inconvenient dependency management. Although it is not recommended for use in new applications, dcrd will have to support ripemd160 _forever_ in order to validate historical transactions and support p2sh scripts that rely on it. In general, it is a good idea to internalize all crypto that dcrd relies on because consensus applications have _much_ stricter requirements than their dependencies, as was demonstrated by OpenSSL [issues](https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2014-04-11-heartbleed) in Bitcoin.

Post v1.5 release, improvements for v1.6 have already begun. Faster [index lookup](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1969) has been enabled by leveraging the spend journal. Code cleanup that couldn't be done until v1.5 release has commenced. Work continues to split the RPC server into its own package as part of a bigger movement to decouple components. Notably, some changes are being ported from contributions to the upstream btcd repository.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): The code has been updated to use new modules from dcrwallet and the latest modules from dcrd, trace code was added to collect performance metrics.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): The redesigned Politeia frontend went live on Oct 29, with a look that matches the other Decred software and a significantly improved mobile experience. A number of performance improvements were also deployed at the same time. It's been many months in the making, congratulations to the Politeia team!

`politeiavoter` was made more resilient to [network errors](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1022).

Work continues on the DCC functionality for the Contractor Management System. The invoicing system was [augmented](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1023) with a way to enter the hours worked by subcontractors, this information will be necessary for assigning voting power in the case of a dispute resolution all-contractor vote.

[dcrstakepool](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool): UI tweaks, bug fixes, cleanup that was on hold till v1.2 release. All inline javascript has been [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/560). Numerous modules were [updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/554) to their latest versions.

Work continues to implement [accountless](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/515) ticket purchasing that will allow making email optional, improve UX and pave the way for eliminating voting address reuse.

[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool): Precision of difficulty and target calculation has been [increased](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/135). The pool was switched from polling for work to getting work [notifications](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/136) via dcrd's new `notifywork` and making use of the new `reason` parameter. Rolling of the timestamp field has also been added. With this dcrpool satisfies all recommendations for working with dcrd v1.5 with maximum efficiency.

[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp): added ability to save JSON and CSV reports of completed mixes, bug fixes.

[dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex): The spec has received several [changes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2019-10-01..2019-10-31+label%3Aspec), including a switch of atomic swap contract to P2SH and a replacement of JSON-RPC with a custom message protocol. New foundational components were built: [communications hub](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/33), [swap coordinator](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/39), [persistent order storage](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/47), [order book subscription router](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/62), [order router](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/65). Simnet [test harness](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/34) was added.

[dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): Work on the new UI continues with an overhauled [home page](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/pull/401) and other improvements to align the app with the standard app design recommendations for Android. Work continues on [multi-wallet support](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrlibwallet/pull/57). This will allow users to import their public key from Decrediton so that they can monitor the status of their tickets from their phones.

[dcrios](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): UI improvements underway for [seed restore](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/pull/527) and [overview](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/pull/526) pages, and the [navigation menu](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/pull/524).

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): Redesigned [blocks listing](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1577), connectivity and performance improvements, bug fixes.

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): Added new page explaining [block production times](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/995), new [glossary terms](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1003), minor updates and cleanup.

[devdocs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdevdocs): Developer documentation was moved to the Decred GitHub org. The site has not officially launched, but can be previewed at [devdocs.decred.org](https://devdocs.decred.org/). If there's anything you'd like to see added, please let us know in the [issues](https://github.com/decred/dcrdevdocs/issues) or by dropping by the [#documentation](https://matrix.to/#/!tfqymymiNgzSUJTHqS:decred.org) channel!

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb): [Exchanges](https://decred.org/exchanges/) page was updated ([Easyrabbit](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/741) and [Cobo custodial wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/745) removed, [Koi Trading](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/731) OTC added). Keybase was [added](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/729) to [Community](https://decred.org/community/) page. A Dev console message was added to [recruit](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/743) web hackers. Piwik analytics was [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/738) (and prior to that it was self-hosted).

Art for the revamped website is mostly complete, copy for new subpages is in progress.

Dev activity stats for October: 243 active PRs, 317 master commits, 67K added and 16K deleted lines spread across 12 repositories. Contributions came from 1-8 developers per repository.

## People

Welcome to new first time contributors with code merged to master: Enrico Bonetti Vieno ([dcrweb](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/commits?author=ebonetti)).

Because our first-time contributor [detector](https://github.com/degeri/decred_contributor_track) only scans commits we have missed two new designers:

- Vlad Kharlantsev (designer from Block 42) has been contributing to [dcrtimegui](https://github.com/decred/dcrtimegui/issues?q=author%3Aharlovski) and [dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues?q=author%3Aharlovski) since May.
- Hannes Dvorjanski (designer from EETER) has been contributing to [Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues?q=author%3Ahqnnes) since the end of September.

## Governance

The payment to contractors for August was made on Oct 2 and reported in the [previous issue](201909.md) of the Journal, it is excluded from the figures below.

In October the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 14,970 DCR and spent 12,539 DCR. Using October's daily average DCR/USD rate of $15.59, this is $233K received and $195K spent. At September's average daily rate of $22.02, the USD figure billed for work completed in that month is $276K. As of Nov 5, Treasury balance is 643,041 DCR ($12.8 million USD at $20.00).

There were 5 new proposals published in October (status as of Nov 8):

- DCR Comic [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2ef74fa5f0b558442cb85b1235c8c551a51ff5d8b8de44dead48b8b59c8fc1de) to produce 6 more comics at a cost of $10,800 was approved with 65% approval and turnout of 28%.
- Coffee Points [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/1b4b72fa08792b6500ef770546c24ee751c2b0fee2975db769722524a2754829) seeking $283,000 to open coffee shops and build a Decred bonus points system was rejected with 3% approval and 25% participation.
- Decred an Economic Phenomenon Research and Education [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/65bde4146b845e7e839d6916d4d8f642bc39c250df5379c2f1e26c4ab778ec1a) from @ammarooni requests $2,000 for work already completed and $6,000 for 3 more months of work. It was approved with 80% support and a 29% turnout.
- [Proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5a1bd4116565d107c1672799ed16cae9e92ec633c6e39d9b463b8218e66ff759) to fund a prize for DotA 2 online games requested $450 for prize money and admin costs. It was rejected with 3% Yes votes and 28% participation.
- [Proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/42b16d2741d58903963d8535e04017bbc3a8193391a83b305f44c082b62e3aa8) to partially fund @evok3d's attendance at the Hackers Congress with $2,050 has been abandoned. Amin edited the proposal with links to the talk and a report, and stated that he did not intend to pursue the proposal further, adding a donation address instead.

Politeia reached one year of operation on Oct 16, and the occasion has been marked with a number of publications:

- Tweets with stats from [@Dustorf](https://twitter.com/lefebvre_dustin/status/1184511963965079552) and [@BlockCommons](https://twitter.com/BlockCommons/status/1184581107578298369)
- [Report](https://blockcommons.red/publication/politeia-at-1/) on data from Politeia's first year by @richardred
- Interview with @jy-p written up in a Crypto Briefing [article](https://cryptobriefing.com/decred-politeia-decentralized-governance/)
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58gTCW7DTMg) review from @Exitus
- [Retrospective](https://blockcommons.red/post/year-of-politeia/) from @richardred

Politeia's redesign went live on Oct 29, bringing the theme into line with Decred's other projects and bringing a number of additional improvements to performance. @lukebp [tweeted](https://twitter.com/lukebp_/status/1189219953855082497) about it, including a note that Politeia could use another talented frontend developer.

@degeri provided an [update](https://bounty.decred.org/2019/10/status-update/) on the bounty program. 16 new reports were processed since July, 1 of which was eligible for a payout - a security [issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1563) in dcrdata (now fixed).

[proposals](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals) repository was started in August with a high-level idea to be a place where stakeholders can quickly find all important information about proposals. Initial data was collected for [DEX](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/tree/master/dex) and [market makers](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/tree/master/market-makers) proposals and included indexes of important documents and discussions, and analysis of said proposals. In October the scope of the repository was extended to also index deliverables and host progress updates for approved proposals. The first batch of indexes and updates was added for [Open Source Research](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/tree/master/research-richardred), [Ditto PR](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/tree/master/pr-ditto) and [Bug Bounty Program](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/tree/master/bug-bounty-program), with more to follow. The big goal is to improve reporting and oversight.

[guidelines](https://github.com/decredcommunity/guidelines) repository was started to collect guiding documents from multiple Decred contributors. Now it has moved under the decredcommunity org to host the new Community Organizer Playbook.

For more in-depth coverage of governance see Politeia Digest [issue 23](https://www.blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue023/) and [issue 24](https://www.blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue024/).

## Network

Hashrate: October's hashrate opened at ~446 Ph/s and closed ~452 Ph/s, bottoming at 339 Ph/s and peaking at 686 Ph/s throughout the month. Pool hashrate distribution as of Nov 2: UUPool 19%, Poolin 15%, F2Pool 5.6%, lab.antpool.com 5%, BTC.com 2.4%, Luxor 1.95%, Coinmine 0.10%, BeePool 0.10%, suprnova 0.01% and others 50% per [dcrstats.com](https://dcrstats.com/pow). Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Notably, in the Nov 2 snapshot the percentage of "Other" (unknown) sources reached 50%, compared to 30% on Oct 2.

As of Nov 8, the hashrate change in the past 30 days is -24% per [dcrdata](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/). Between Oct 9-25 the average hashrate went down from ~500 to ~400 Ph/s and the difficulty from ~38B to ~29B. This decline correlated with the DCR/USD price going below $16.5 down to $13.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was 132.3 DCR (+3.6) per dcrstats.com. The price varied between 120.8-142.3 DCR. The locked amount was 5.22-5.38 million DCR, which corresponded to 49.59-50.97% of the available supply.

A spike of missed votes was [observed](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=missed-votes&zoom=jo8rgw2w-k2qdkju0&bin=window&axis=time) on Oct 18-19 (thanks to the new chart). There is no information about the root cause.

Nodes: Throughout [October](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=1569888000000&to=1572566400000) there were around 146 listening nodes and 402 total nodes per dcr.farm. Based on monthly average node counts, roughly 76% run dcrd v1.4.0, 7.5% are v1.5.0 and 0.7% are v1.6.0(pre) dev builds. 9.4% of nodes were dcrwallet v1.4 in SPV mode.

As of Nov 8, around 17% of PoS voters are signaling that they have upgraded and are ready to vote for the consensus rule change, per [dcrdata](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/agendas). Considering that there was no final v1.5 release yet, it shows that a lot of voters care to install release candidates or build from source.

According to the [tweet](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1183770504580206593) from Oct 14, about 15% of tickets are using private transactions, making the anonymity set of 7.5% of all DCR in circulation.

## Outreach

Outreach activities continued to execute against the privacy release including a Decred Assembly [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWdA1C-SHSk) featuring @jrick, but the focus shifted to bread and butter topics such as governance, DAOs, and projects in the pipeline. A [Community Organizer Playbook](https://github.com/decredcommunity/guidelines/blob/master/community-organizer-playbook.md) was published to share best practices with community members and includes an Events guide, which was initiated by @eSizeDave and @zohand from Australia. These tools are designed to help enable community members to build the Decred ecosystem of users, developers, partners, and media, across the world. If you see ways to improve it please comment [here](https://github.com/decredcommunity/guidelines/pull/5).

Decred in Depth released two episodes in October: @zubair on [DCR Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FX2ZncHIAd4) and Alex Feinberg on [OKCoin's perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBRjkjbmYDc). Community members across the ecosystem contributed immensely to the outreach and education efforts, most notably [@BlackBearXVII](https://medium.com/@imagnusholdings), who is publishing a ten-part Medium series on Decred; @permabullnino, who published [Decred On-Chain: A Look at Block Subsidies](https://medium.com/@permabullnino/decred-on-chain-a-look-at-block-subsidies-6f5180932c9b); @Checkmate, who released a wide variety of research and tweet threads; @Exitus, who recorded a [video](https://twitter.com/coveryfire7777/status/1186075335076528130) on the first year of Politeia; and @richardred, who released a [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/BlockCommons/status/1184581107578298369) of data on Politeia's first year, as well as [Peer Production on the Crypto Commons](https://twitter.com/RichardRed0x/status/1190315513043472385), a free book he has been working on since the start of 2019.

With a revamped website coming soon, an uptick in Decred social media activity, and a continued flurry of research and publication materials, Decred is well on its way to closing the gap on the information asymmetry.

It was a deep dive into blockchain governance and sound money, Decred's governance model and overall design. The crowd was well versed in crypto, they found the content very informative and turned the Q&A session into an hour-long in-depth discussion. A follow-up session was requested. ([report](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/blob/master/reports/20191029-decred-governance-workshop-singapore.md), [photos](https://twitter.com/GuangGuang168/status/1189381286458089473))

## Media

This month saw the release of two new websites which have been produced as part of the [Decred Open Source Research](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/67de0e901143400ae2f247391c4d5028719ffea8308fbc5854745ad859fb993f) program.

[Peer Production on the Crypto Commons](https://www.cryptocommons.cc/) is a free book authored by @richardred. It considers how a number of different constituencies (miners, developers, merchants, users) work together to produce a blockchain and give it value. It also considers blockchains as a type of common pool resource built with open source software, and what the broader implications of this are.

[BlockCommons.red](https://www.blockcommons.red/) is a site which hosts research and educational content about "the crypto commons", including the [Pi Research](https://www.blockcommons.red/#reports) and [Crypto Governance Research](https://www.blockcommons.red/crypto-governance-research/overviews/) write-ups. [Politeia Digest](https://www.blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/) has also moved there (although it will continue to be published on Medium and GitHub also).

[textassets](https://github.com/decredcommunity/textassets) repository was created to collect text pieces from various websites and social media platforms. Having all texts in one place allows to quickly find outdated texts using a simple text search. It also allows the use of GitHub features to discuss and collaborate on future changes before implementing them (a recent example is the [update](https://github.com/decredcommunity/textassets/pull/1) of Reddit sidebar).

Iterative Capital [introduced](https://iterative.capital/introducing-escher-hub-making-every-foss-wallet-a-cheap-and-fast-way-to-transact-bitcoin/) Escher, a Lightning-enabled BTC-USD on and off-ramp that can connect Bitcoin wallets and Lightning channels to users' bank accounts. Developers of FOSS cryptocurrency wallets can integrate with Escher Hub, which will allow users to manage the wallets and channels they control and move funds between BTC and USD easily. Chris Dannen [stated](https://twitter.com/chrisdannen/status/1187387952386707457) on Twitter that DCR is the only other cryptocurrency that support is planned for.

A [review](https://blog.coincodecap.com/dead-coins-on-crypto-exchanges/) of 3,162 projects by CoinCodeCap found that 1,240 of these had no code commits in the previous 90 days and by this criterion were considered dead. The report also considers centralized and decentralized exchanges in terms of how many dead projects they list.

A [proposal](https://ethereumclassic.org/blog/2019-10-06-pow-mining-explicit-social-contract/) has been made within the Ethereum Classic community for an explicit social contract in favor of PoW mining. There was apparently strong social consensus at the recent ETC conference in Vancouver and an ECIP is being prepared for consideration. ECIP editors will decide whether the proposal is approved, the intention of approving it would be to signal to PoW miners that the community intends to support them for the long run.

A Bitcoin Mining Parliament has been [proposed](https://coinspice.io/news/radical-proposal-bitcoin-mining-parliament-drama-ending-governance-or-more-alienating-devs/) by Javier Gonzalez as a way for miners to coordinate by voting with their hashpower on proposals about the consensus rules.

The 3rd round of Gitcoin quadratic funding was completed, and Vitalik Buterin wrote a [post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/10/24/gitcoin.html) about it. In total $163K was donated to 80 projects by 477 contributors, augmented by a matching pool of $100K. Buterin compared Gitcoin's funding with that of the Ethereum Foundation and found that it was more inclined to fund projects that were valued by the community. The version of quadratic funding was changed from previous rounds to make it less susceptible to the kind of manipulation that had occurred.

The linked [blog post](https://crypto-bridge.org/2019/10/01/introducing-user-verification/) assures that this is great for users.

Tired of missing out on the global crypto market, Poloniex is [leaving](https://blog.circle.com/2019/10/18/poloniex-to-spin-out-of-circle/) U.S. jurisdiction to focus on an international cryptocurrency exchange backed by an Asian investment group.

In the United States, the IRS has updated the main form used by individual taxpayers to add a question about whether the person had interacted with cryptocurrencies during the year. According to this [tweet](https://twitter.com/allyversprille/status/1184827340737654785), IRS Chief Counsel Michael Desmond thinks there are around 12 million taxpayers that should be reporting cryptocurrency assets.

The IRS has also ["clarified"](https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/news/2019/oct/irs-income-cryptocurrency-hard-forks-airdrops-201922209.html) its position on the receipt of forked coins and airdrops. The position has been widely criticized, as it would mean that every time a ledger is forked all of the holders must report the coins they received on the new chain.

U.S. Federal Reserve will buy about [$60B of Treasury bills](https://www.ft.com/content/baa7e796-ec38-11e9-85f4-d00e5018f061) per month for at least 6 months. They call it "_organic growth_ of the central bank's balance sheet" and try very hard to not call it _QE4_, which appears to be finally gaining a negative connotation after multiple rounds of money creation that did not solve the problem. Market interventions by the Fed [started](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_190917) on Sep 17 when for some reasons there was not enough liquidity in the "repo market". Some observations: 1) Fed has not had to do this since the financial crisis of 2008; 2) Fed and ECB began their interventions around the same time; 3) just like with ECB, it is very hard to understand how it works exactly. Similar to the [previous](201909.md#relevant-external) question to the ECB, it is unknown how hard the Fed worked to earn the money. Feel free to bring some clarity in Reddit comments.

Austrian central bank Governor thinks that ECB's QE is [counterproductive](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-13/ecb-s-holzmann-says-draghi-s-qe-policy-is-counterproductive).

A flaw was [identified](https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/14/linux-unix-sudo-command-security-flaw/?guccounter=1) in the ubiquitous sudo command of Linux. It would allow anyone with sudo access on the machine to gain full root privileges if exploited. Make sure to update your systems.

The Internet has celebrated 50 years. On Oct 29, 1969, the first data was sent between two computers - a crazy idea back then. The first message to transmit was "login" but the receiving computer crashed after getting 'o'. "So, the first message was 'Lo' as in 'Lo and behold'. We couldn't have a better, more succinct first message" [noted](https://usa.inquirer.net/44807/ucla-anniversary-kleinrocks-technology-lab) Leonard Kleinrock, who led the experiment. When speaking about the "dark side" of the Internet he remained optimistic: "I still feel that the benefits are far more significant; I wouldn't turn off the internet if I could" and expressed interest in blockchain tech.
