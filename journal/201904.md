## Governance

{high level recap of decision-making activity, most important events, defer to Politeia Digest for the rest}

In April the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received {} DCR and spent {} DCR. Using April's daily average DCR/USD rate of ${}, this is ${}K received and ${}K spent. As these payments were for work completed in {prev month}, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the {prev month} average daily rate of ${} - in which case the USD received/spent figures are ${}K/${}K. As of {date}, Treasury balance is {} DCR ({} million USD at ${}).

Proposal status as of {}:

* Ghana proposal rejected by {}% No votes among {}K voted tickets. @bee posted late follow-up analysis https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/b9vhee/voting_has_started_for_the_bring_decred_to_africa/eks6578/

Decentralize Treasury Spending proposal attracted a lot of discussion and got featured in the news. A lot of implementation details are omitted by design:

> the reason is that in the many years of software development we have learned to only plan two steps ahead and evaluate where we stand after achieving set goals. Planning too far ahead pretty much always ends with reality colliding with the plan. So, yes it is hand-wavy but by design. Once the technical realities become apparent we can let them dictate the process.

Comm systems news:

* Servers hosting matrix.org and riot.im compromised and taken down on Apr 11 for emergency security maintenance, disrupting our communications for several hours. If your homeserver is matrix.org, change your password. Incident report [here](https://matrix.org/blog/2019/04/11/security-incident/), tweet timeline [here](https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1116304867683905537), and [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/issues/371) are recommendations from the hacker to the admins. Decred's homeserver (matrix.decred.org) was not affected. {clarify with admins}. A good moment to say thanks to our admins who work every day to keep a lot of self-hosted infrastructure running. The incident disrupted our comms for many hours because many people are using the browser Riot.im client which was taken offline. To be resilient against such issues, users should consider installing standalone client (desktop or mobile). Another idea is to [self-host Riot](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/62).
* There were multiple interruptions in the bridge and many messages were not delivered from Slack to Matrix between ~Apr 1-15.
* Matrix is moving to stop supporting self-signed certificates and rely on Certificate Authorities to behave.
* {someone please comment on how Telegram groups evolve and what interesting is going on}
* Trivia: did you know there are [12 mods](https://medium.com/decred/decred-independent-contractor-roadmap-884faba3db39) in the Telegram group? {accurate info?}
* Fake account impersonating as "Decred" were detected on Facebook running giveaways. Stay vigilant.
