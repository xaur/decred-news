## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{ hint: add below overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warrants a paragraph, drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans }

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

Month's highlight is the addition of [UTXO cache](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2591) that cuts initial blockchain download (IBD) time by ~33% at the cost of some extra memory. It is also a required step towards [multi-peer](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1145) parallel block downloading.

Another highlight is the [introduction](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2579) of Age-Partioned Bloom Filters (APBF). APBF is a lookup device that can quickly tell if it contains an element. It can track _lot_ of data while using little memory, at the cost of a controlled rate of false positives. Unlike classic Bloom filters, it can handle unbounded amount of data by aging and discarding old items. The motivation for adding ABPFs to Decred is to replace the LRU (least recently used) cache used to continuously track what data other peers are known to have. A benchmark of one use case indicated a reduction of memory use from ~200 to ~5 MiB. `apbf` package will be [useful](https://matrix.to/#/!zefvTnlxYHPKvJMThI:decred.org/$ulmCeMPuDSSmt3KTB09fJpypa4fpooFILTXKtQNWUCg) for other projects like wallet, DEX, mobile wallets, etc. Read the details in full glory in the [PR](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2579) and the [README](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/master/container/apbf). { is it too much of an intro? it's just too exciting and hard to not sing about }

Other merged work:

- primary filter operations in `abpf` package made more than twice [faster](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2584) with smart bit-level math
- tracking of recently [confirmed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2580) transactions and [addresses](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2583) known by peers switched to use ABPFs for a ~97% reduction in memory use
- tracking or recently [rejected](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2590) tx also switched to ABPFs, with extra benefits of lowering bandwidth usage in high rejection scenarios while simultaneously increasing robustness against malicious peers
- `reject` message [deprecated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2586) towards its eventual removal in future versions (read [this](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2546) for a list of privacy and correctness issues with this message)

These two changes merged in both master and the v1.6.1 patch release:

- notification logic [modified](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2597) to force proof-of-work miners to upgrade so that voting on the new consensus changes can commence
- fixed a rare [issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2582) where connections might not be reestablished after a network outage

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

Merged in both master and v1.6.1 release:

- new method to set ticket [vote choice](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1981) at the associated VSP via the new vspd protocol (used by Decrediton)
- when the account only has a single output, create an extra transaction to make enough [outputs](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1980) for a VSP ticket purchase, and use the resulting [fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2005) output (fixes the "not enough utxos" [error](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/lebx71/error_when_trying_to_purchase_tickets_with/))
- skip [unpublished](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1985) transactions when selecting outputs and clear unpublished status when the tx is mined (fixes certain double spend cases)
- return [error](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1990) from `signrawtransaction` if the transaction has no inputs
- save [mixed](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1989) output transactions and watch outputs
- consider [tx fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1992) when choosing a mix amount and count to avoid unmixable outputs
- fixed unpublished transactions' outputs being included in the [spendable](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2002) balance
- fixed a chance to pay a very [high fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2002) during mixing (this was a regression between v1.6.0 and v1.6.1, i.e. did not affect any release)
- updated salsa20 and blake2b [dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1998) to prevent possible memory corruption

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

- validate that clients pay enough transaction [fees](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/58) (and close a DoS vector)
- remove [timed-out](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/60) clients to prevent possible server hangs
- isolate state for different [runs](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/61) to prevent possible aborted mixes

**[dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex)**

v0.1.5 release is out, fixing several rough edges. Get the release notes and downloads [here](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.6.1#dcrdex-v015), or grab [dcrinstall](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/releases) and run `dcrinstall --dcrdex`, and it will download, verify and configure everything for you. [Verify](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/verifying-binaries/) the initial download to ensure it came unmodified.

Merged in master and the v0.1.5 patch release:

- handle orders that somehow [lose](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/967) their funding coins
- make client init and redeem requests [asynchronous](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/911) to not block actions that could occur in parallel
- retry contract audits when [resuming](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/965) trades on startup and login, to prevent mathces from being incorrectly revoked
- blake2 dependency [updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/982) to prevent silent memory corruption

{ how long v0.1 will be supported? }

Merged in master towards v0.2 release:

- [estimate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/958) low, high and max possible fees during swap and redemption transactions to offer some additional clarity on fees instead of just showing the worst-case value
- write a [backup](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/949) file prior to upgrading the database
- switch client from btcsuite's to Decred's [rpcclient](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/938) because the latter [supports](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/841) request cancellation
- move wallet locking code during [shutdown](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/928) to a better place

You can track what's coming on the milestone pages for [0.2](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/milestone/6) (server market data, UI+backend improvements) and [0.3](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/milestone/12) (SPV, BCH, Decred 1.7).

**Kohola**

@peter\_zen [shared](https://matrix.to/#/!aNnAOHkWUdNcEXRGjJ:decred.org/$uc4-7jDq7LehB55bK3sAjq9qL-g2WDJ8wOW5HZTvknI):


> Announcing a project I and @bgptr have been working on last year: https://github.com/peterzen/kohola
> 
> Kohola is a dcrwallet frontend I started for my own needs which weren't covered by Decrediton. It's not feature complete yet but I've been using it as my production wallet. Work on it stalled some months ago due to other priorities but I thought I'd share it in its present state as other peeps may find it useful. In case it proves some usefulness it would be great to finish it.

According to the GitHub [repo](https://github.com/peterzen/kohola), Kohola wallet is intended for expert users and offers features like encrypted configuration, solo staking support, coin control, and labelling coins to keep track of user's own privacy { clarify what works }. The app is written in Go and TypeScript using React and Redux frameworks. Importantly, Kohola means "whale" in Hawaiian.

Other:

- @dezryth shared a Python [program](https://github.com/dezryth/VotedTicketNotifier) that will send push notifications to your mobile device when your tickets vote
- most projects are now building and testing with Go 1.16

## Governance

In February the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 10,444 DCR and spent 3,010 DCR (actually payments didn't go out until Mar 2). Using February's daily average DCR/USD rate of $113.76, this is $1.2M received and $342K spent. At January's average daily rate of $54.25, the USD figure billed for past work is $163K. As of Mar 3, Treasury balance is 653,000 DCR (97.2 million USD at $148.86).

After the record-breaking turnout for two proposals at the start of Feb (covered in the last issue), the rest of the month was relatively quiet, with two further proposals being approved.

* The Decred Journal 2021 [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/1d74b88) was approved with 92.4% Yes votes and turnout of 51%, thanks to all the stakeholders who voted for the Journal's first solo proposal! The amount of funding requested for the year is $39,000, and it also covers Politeia Digest and all of the associated Design work.
* The Open Source Research 2021 proposal from @richard-red was approved with 75.4% Yes votes and turnout of 60% - the requested budget has increased to $40,000, and $9,150 of this is set aside for the expansion of @bee's open data collection initiative.

## Network

{ section hint:

- check dcrdata.org (preferred), dcrstats.com and charts.dcr.farm to get the numbers
- use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

Hashrate: February's [hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=t1-t2&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month. Pool hashrate [distribution](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) as of {date}: {pool name n%, ...}.

{ hint: fallback link for pool distribution: https://dcrstats.com/pow }

Staking: [30-day average](https://dcrstats.com/) ticket price was {n.d, try to snapshot it on 1st} DCR (+{n.d}). The [price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=t1-t2&bin=window&axis=time&visibility=true-false&mode=stepped) {set zoom to show the month} varied between {n.d}-{n.d} DCR. [Locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=t1-t2&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was {n.dd}-{n.dd} million DCR, which corresponded to {n.d}-{n.d}% of the available supply [participating](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=t1-t2&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in PoS.
