## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

The v1.6.1 patch release included the following changes:

- notification logic [modified](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2597) to force proof-of-work miners to upgrade so that voting on the new consensus changes can commence
- fixed a rare [issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2582) where connections might not be reestablished after a network outage

In development towards the next release, this month's highlight is the addition of a [UTXO cache](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2591) that cuts initial blockchain download (IBD) time by ~33% at the cost of some extra memory. It also significantly speeds up block processing during normal operation and reduces the wear and tear on the storage medium by allowing entries that are created and spent between flushing intervals to avoid being written at all. UTXO cache is a required step towards [multi-peer](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1145) parallel block downloading.

Another highlight is the [introduction](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2579) of Age-Partitioned Bloom Filters. APBF is a lookup device that can quickly tell if it contains an element. It can track _a lot_ of data while using little memory, at the cost of a controlled rate of false positives. Unlike classic Bloom filters, it can handle an unbounded amount of data by aging and discarding old items. The motivation for adding APBFs to Decred is to replace the LRU (least recently used) cache used to continuously track what data other peers are known to have. For a concrete example, the memory to track addresses known by 125 peers is reduced from ~200 to ~5 MiB when using APBFs. Also, the package will be [useful](https://matrix.to/#/!zefvTnlxYHPKvJMThI:decred.org/$ulmCeMPuDSSmt3KTB09fJpypa4fpooFILTXKtQNWUCg) for other projects like wallet, DEX, mobile wallets, etc. Read the details in full glory in the [PR](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2579) and the [README](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/master/container/apbf).

Other merged work:

- primary operations in `apbf` package made more than two times [faster](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2584) with smart bit-level math
- tracking of recently [confirmed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2580) transactions and [addresses](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2583) known by peers switched to use APBFs
- tracking of recently [rejected](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2590) transactions also switched to APBFs, with extra benefits of lowering bandwidth usage in high rejection scenarios while simultaneously increasing robustness against malicious peers
- `reject` message [deprecated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2586) towards its eventual removal in future versions (read [this](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2546) for a list of privacy and correctness issues with this message)

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

Changes merged and released with v1.6.1 patch:

- new gRPC method to set ticket [vote choice](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1981) at the associated VSP via the new vspd protocol (used by Decrediton)
- when the account only has a single output, create an extra transaction to make enough [outputs](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1980) for a VSP ticket purchase, and use the resulting [fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2005) output (fixes the "not enough utxos" [error](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/lebx71/error_when_trying_to_purchase_tickets_with/))
- skip [unpublished](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1985) transactions when selecting outputs and clear unpublished status when the tx is mined (fixes certain double spend cases)
- consider [tx fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1992) when mixing to avoid unmixable outputs
- fixed outputs from unpublished transactions being included in the [spendable](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2002) balance
- fixed a chance to pay a very [high fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2002) during mixing (this was a regression between v1.6.0 and v1.6.1, i.e. did not affect any release)
- updated salsa20 and blake2b [dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1998) to prevent possible memory corruption
- return [error](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1990) from `signrawtransaction` if the transaction has no inputs
- save [mixed](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1989) output transactions and watch outputs

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

> Announcing a project I and @bgptr have been working on last year: https://github.com/peterzen/kohola
> 
> Kohola is a dcrwallet frontend I started for my own needs which weren't covered by Decrediton. It's not feature complete yet but I've been using it as my production wallet. Work on it stalled some months ago due to other priorities but I thought I'd share it in its present state as other peeps may find it useful. In case it proves some usefulness it would be great to finish it.

According to the GitHub [repo](https://github.com/peterzen/kohola), this wallet is intended for expert users and offers features like encrypted configuration, solo staking support, coin control, and more. The app is written in Go and TypeScript using React and Redux frameworks. Notably, Kohola means "whale" in Hawaiian.

Other:

- @dezryth shared a Python [program](https://github.com/dezryth/VotedTicketNotifier) that will send push notifications to your mobile device when your tickets vote
- most projects are now building and testing with Go 1.16

## Governance

In February the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 10,444 DCR and spent 3,010 DCR (actually payments didn't go out until Mar 2). Using February's daily average DCR/USD rate of $113.76, this is $1.2M received and $342K spent. At January's average daily rate of $54.25, the USD figure billed for past work is $163K. As of Mar 3, Treasury balance is 653,000 DCR (97.2 million USD at $148.86).

After the record-breaking turnout for two proposals at the start of Feb (covered in the [last issue](202101.md)), the rest of the month was relatively quiet, with two further proposals being approved.

* The Decred Journal 2021 [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/1d74b88) was approved with 92.4% Yes votes and turnout of 51%, thanks to all the stakeholders who voted for the Journal's first solo proposal! The amount of funding requested for the year is $39,000, and it also covers Politeia Digest and all of the associated Design work.
* The Open Source Research 2021 proposal from @richard-red was approved with 75.4% Yes votes and turnout of 60% - the requested budget has increased to $40,000, and $9,150 of this is set aside for the expansion of @bee's open data collection initiative.

## Network

{ section hint:

- check dcrdata.org (preferred), dcrstats.com, and charts.dcr.farm to get the numbers
- use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

Hashrate: February's [hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=kkf13di6-kltwy2po&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~428 Ph/s and closed ~420 Ph/s, bottoming at 278 Ph/s and peaking at 537 Ph/s throughout the month.

Pool hashrate [distribution](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) as of Mar 1: Poolin 36%, Antpool 34%, F2Pool 8%, Luxor 2%, BTC.com 1.5%, Huobipool 0.8%, Coinmine 0.08%, UUPool 0.03%, unknown 18%.

Instant snapshots are too volatile, so compare that to how 1,000 blocks (3.5 days) mined before Mar 1 are distributed: Antpool 41%, Poolin 29%, easy2mine 11%, F2Pool 6%, Luxor 1.5%, Huobipool 0.4%, unknown 11%.

UUPool's reported hashrate has dropped from the top spot to the bottom and it looks like its miners have migrated to Antpool and F2Pool. New unidentified addresses are also showing up.

{ hint: fallback link for pool distribution: https://dcrstats.com/pow }

Staking: [Ticket price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=kkf13di6-kltwy2po&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between 154.3-220.4 DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at 181.7 DCR (+8.5). The [locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=kkf13di6-kltwy2po&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was 6.74-7.30 million DCR, meaning that 53.6-57.7% of the circulating supply [participated](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=kkf13di6-kltwy2po&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.

It looks like we are [breaking](https://twitter.com/michae2xl/status/1359609723541213186) a record every month in terms of both ticket price and participation!

Yearn Finance was February's largest DeFi [Fail](https://cryptobriefing.com/hacker-spends-8-3-million-fees-attack-yearn-finance/), with a flash loan attack exploiting its users for $11 million. In an interesting development for this kind of attack, most of the exploited funds were paid in [fees](https://twitter.com/FrankResearcher/status/1357639434380992512/photo/1) to various liquidity pools and staking services, with just $2.7 million ending up in the attacker's pocket, and the rest presumably fuelling the DeFi economy. The victims of the attack have been [compensated](https://twitter.com/iearnfinance/status/1359108691677614080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1359108691677614080%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fyearn-finance-puts-expanded-treasury-to-use-by-repaying-victims-of-11m-hack) from the new pool of Treasury funds that was recently minted - within 4 days of the hack the Yearn team were able to mobilize 9.7 million DAI to distribute, and no token voting was required. YFI and the Treasury are currently under the direct control of the Multisig holders, and that "empowerment" is being [extended](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-59-temporarily-extend-multisig-empowerment/9746) until May 24.

Yearn Finance is also [changing](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-56-buyback-and-build/8929) up its Treasury and governance funding model [significantly](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-56-buyback-and-build/8929), major changes include scrapping YFI staking because of its uncompetitive yield and instead switching to a buyback model and allowing YFI holders who have deployed their tokens in a liquidity pool to also use them to vote. 

Bitcoin developers are in the [process](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1359934584612212738) of deciding how the [Taproot](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/taproot-coming-what-it-and-how-it-will-benefit-bitcoin) upgrade should be activated, with the point of contention being whether the Bitcoin Core update should ship with a setting that has it activating at the end of the signalling period regardless of whether the supermajority threshold is met (like the User Activated Soft Fork) or take a more cautious approach and avoid forcing the issue initially. Miner signalling for the month to Mar 2 showed 89% support for Taproot from pools according to their hashrate.

The Central Bank of Nigeria has moved to remind banks that "dealing in cryptocurrencies or facilitating payments for cryptocurrency exchanges is prohibited" and [instructed](https://www.coindesk.com/nigerias-central-bank-orders-banks-to-close-accounts-of-all-crypto-users) them to close the accounts of all people and entities who trade in cryptocurrencies.

The US Federal Reserve experienced an [issue](https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/24/federal_reserve_outage/) with its inter-bank transfer system which impaired service for hours. This happened soon after US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had [warned](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/yellen-sounds-warning-about-extremely-inefficient-bitcoin.html) that Bitcoin is "extremely inefficient" and poses risk to investors.

@notsofast urges everyone to learn from his [mistakes](https://cryptonews.com/news/trader-s-lesson-why-you-shouldn-t-keep-large-amounts-of-cry-9302.htm) that have led to losing ~$100,000 in crypto in a security breach: get a good password manager, use a hardware wallet, isolate dangerous browser extensions like Metamask in separate browser profiles or devices.
