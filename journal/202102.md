## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{ hint: add below overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warrants a paragraph, drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans }

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

Month's highlight is the addition of [UTXO cache](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2591) that cuts initial blockchain download (IBD) time by ~33% at the cost of some extra memory usage.

Another highlight is the [introduction](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2579) of Age-Partioned Bloom Filters (APBF). APBF is a lookup device that can quickly tell if it contains an element. It can track _lot_ of data while using little memory, at the cost of a controlled rate of false positives. Unlike classic Bloom filters, it can handle unbounded amount of data by aging and discarding old items. The motivation for adding ABPFs to Decred is to replace the LRU (least recently used) cache used to continuously track what data other peers are known to have. A benchmark of one use case indicated a reduction of memory use from ~200 to ~5 MiB. `apbf` package will be [useful](https://matrix.to/#/!zefvTnlxYHPKvJMThI:decred.org/$ulmCeMPuDSSmt3KTB09fJpypa4fpooFILTXKtQNWUCg) for other projects like wallet, DEX, mobile wallets, etc. Read the details in full glory in the [PR](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2579) and the [README](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/master/container/apbf). { is it too much of an intro? it's just too exciting and hard to not sing about }

Other merged work:

- primary filter operations in `abpf` package made more than twice [faster](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2584) with smart bit-level math
- tracking of recently [confirmed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2580) transactions and [addresses](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2583) known by peers switched to use ABPFs for a ~97% reduction in memory use
- tracking or recently [rejected](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2590) tx also switched to ABPFs, with extra benefits of lowering bandwidth usage in high rejection scenarios while simultaneously increasing robustness against malicious peers
- `reject` message [deprecated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2586) towards its eventual removal in future versions (read [this](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2546) for a list of privacy and correctness issues with this message)

These two changes merged in both master and the v1.6.1 patch release:

- notification logic [modified](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2597) to force proof-of-work miners to upgrade so that voting on the new consensus changes can commence
- fixed a rare [issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2582) where connections might not be reestablished after a network outage

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

Merged in both master and v1.6.1 release:

- new method to set ticket [vote choice](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1981) at the associated VSP via the new vspd protocol (used by Decrediton)
- when the account only has a single output, create an extra transaction to make enough [outputs](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1980) for a VSP ticket purchase, and use the resulting [fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2005) output (fixes the "not enough utxos" [error](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/lebx71/error_when_trying_to_purchase_tickets_with/))
- skip [unpublished](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1985) transactions when selecting outputs and clear unpublished status when the tx is mined (fixes certain double spend cases)
- return [error](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1990) from `signrawtransaction` if the transaction has no inputs
- save [mixed](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1989) output transactions and watch outputs
- consider [tx fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1992) when choosing a mix amount and count to avoid unmixable outputs
- fixed unpublished transactions' outputs being included in the [spendable](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2002) balance
- fixed a chance to pay a very [high fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2002) during mixing (this was a regression between v1.6.0 and v1.6.1, i.e. did not affect any release)
- updated salsa20 and blake2b [dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1998) to prevent possible memory corruption

## Governance

In February the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 10,444 DCR and spent 3,010 DCR (actually payments didn't go out until Mar 2). Using February's daily average DCR/USD rate of $113.76, this is $1.2M received and $342K spent. At January's average daily rate of $54.25, the USD figure billed for past work is $163K. As of Mar 3, Treasury balance is 653,000 DCR (97.2 million USD at $148.86).

After the record-breaking turnout for two proposals at the start of Feb (covered in the last issue), the rest of the month was relatively quiet, with two further proposals being approved.

* The Decred Journal 2021 [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/1d74b88) was approved with 92.4% Yes votes and turnout of 51%, thanks to all the stakeholders who voted for the Journal's first solo proposal! The amount of funding requested for the year is $39,000, and it also covers Politeia Digest and all of the associated Design work.
* The Open Source Research 2021 proposal from @richard-red was approved with 75.4% Yes votes and turnout of 60% - the requested budget has increased to $40,000, and $9,150 of this is set aside for the expansion of @bee's open data collection initiative.

## Network

{ section hint:

- check dcrdata.org (preferred), dcrstats.com and charts.dcr.farm to get the numbers
- use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

Hashrate: February's [hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=t1-t2&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month. Pool hashrate [distribution](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) as of {date}: {pool name n%, ...}.

{ hint: fallback link for pool distribution: https://dcrstats.com/pow }

Staking: [30-day average](https://dcrstats.com/) ticket price was {n.d, try to snapshot it on 1st} DCR (+{n.d}). The [price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=t1-t2&bin=window&axis=time&visibility=true-false&mode=stepped) {set zoom to show the month} varied between {n.d}-{n.d} DCR. [Locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=t1-t2&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was {n.dd}-{n.dd} million DCR, which corresponded to {n.d}-{n.d}% of the available supply [participating](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=t1-t2&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in PoS.

{ recap of ticket price action if it was interesting }

{ hint: for dcr.farm set the zoom to show exactly UTC month 1st 00:00:00 - next month 1st 00:00:00 }
