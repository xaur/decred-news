## Governance

{recap of decision-making activity, including new proposals, changes to proposals, voting, discussions, pre-proposal drafts, etc}

Part of November was reported in the previous issue due to late release.

@snr01 provided nice charts. Multiple people started hacking on Politeia data in #proposals and #research.

Low quality proposals cluttering Politeia were disussed in depth and multiple ideas were suggested. @richardred gave a nice overview of this in Politeia Digest #4.

## Network

Hashrate: {start, end, low, high, variation; pool distribution}

Staking: {30-day average tix price, low, high, locked DCR million and % of avail supply}

After the price dropped to 97.1, 1,378 tickets were purchased in a single window that bumped the price to 110.2 after 9 subsequent price increases. This is the new all time high on new sdiff algorithm that is in effect since Jul 2017.

Nodes: {node counts, version distribution}

## Mining

The Whatsminer D1 [turned out](https://twitter.com/Pangolinminer/status/1061521332498624512) to be 48 TH/s, 9% up from expected 44 TH/s. The price is $4,850 [from Pangolin](https://pangolinminer.com/product/whatsminer-dcr-with-psu-shipout-on-dec-5/).

## Markets

{markets overview: USD and BTC prices, highs and lows, interesting events, interesting analysis}

Nov 14-15 BTC drop, most top 100 cryptoassets lost 10-20% together with the BTC dive to 5400 USDT / 5200 USD. This happened just a day before the BCH split.

The Media [believes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-16/crypto-winter-comes-early-as-bitcoin-slide-spurs-viability-fears) the BTC dump was sparked by some pump for Bitcoin Cash fork, citing fear, uncertainty and doubt of some guys.

Nov 19-20 bloody day, BTC down to $4300 {right?}, DCR down to $22.

## Relevant External

{PoW, ASIC resistance, tech}

Nvidia [reported](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nvidia-q3-results-reveal-crypto-hangover-due-to-disappearance-of-miner-sales) a drop in GPU sales for mining. This must have nothing to do with Ethereum, Zcash and others receiving ASICs for their GPU-oriented mining algorithms, but rather "it is really the canary in the coal mine for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies" per [the experts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-16/crypto-winter-comes-early-as-bitcoin-slide-spurs-viability-fears). Seriously guys, it is the [collapse](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-15/nvidia-gives-weak-forecast-citing-inventory-stock-slumps) of cryptocurrency mining.

Ethereum Foundation is funding [efforts](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-foundation-filecoin-back-plan-to-make-proof-of-stake-hardware) to create ASICs that compute [Verifiable Delay Function](https://vdfresearch.org/) (VDF) as a replacement for Proof-of-Work mining for blockchain security. [This article](https://medium.com/@djrtwo/vdfs-are-not-proof-of-work-91ba3bec2bf4) compares VDF and Proof-of-Work.

Zcash [approved](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2018Q2/issues/15#issuecomment-436106276) funding of ProgPoW prototype for Zcash. This ASIC-resistant, GPU-friendly algorithm that was also [proposed](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/0aaab331075d08cb03333d5a1bef04b99a708dcbfebc8f8c94040ceb1676e684) in Politeia recently.

{BCH Rust impl https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-community-introduced-to-new-bch-library-written-in-rust/}

According to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9sq0jj/shady_behavior_from_groestlcoin_grs_developers/), yet another coin with claimed ASIC resistance received an ASIC while the developers removed ASIC resistance claims from the website. Reddit thread that questioned this was [wiped out](https://archive.today/SzoHs). An instance where transparent censorship is missing. (_missed in Oct issue_)

A paper was [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0321-8) in Nature Climate journal that suggests Bitcoin PoW mining will have significant negative impact on climate change. [Discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!NKtIRqGOEGaZvSQkKl:decred.org/$15412120277994HzToF:decred.org) in #random noted serious misunderstandings of how PoW works and alarmingly low quality of the paper, along with some guesses who and why could post it.

Zcash is [looking into](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/announcing-zcash-blossom-and-proposed-feature-goals/31891) hybrid ASIC-GPU mining, among other improvements planned for next year's protocol upgrade.

{governance, forks

{BCH forks
* Bitcoin Cash, born as a solution to disagreement with Bitcoin, is splitting into 2 chains (correct?). SV = Satoshi's Vision? Again?
* (does the community split or is it a horror story by the media?)
* explain 1) why they are forking, 2) vision and tech behind SV and ABC, 3) people, companies and capital behind both
* what has Cobra to do with it?
* https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2018/11/05/looming-fork-pushed-bitcoin-cash-up-almost-40-over-the-weekend-heres-why/
* https://news.bitcoin.com/discussions-intensify-as-bch-fork-approaches/
* nice overview https://medium.com/circle-research/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-report-4e4377d514a
  * both projects get individually weaker
  * SV is quite aggressive to ABC and hopes to dedicate some hashrate to mining empty blocks on the ABC chain (and not to secure the SV chain)
* nice high-level overview: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/when-fork-forks-what-you-need-know-bitcoin-cash-goes-war/
* https://cash.coin.dance/ nice site for following the "hash war"
* Live stream which ran for 8 hours with appearances from Vitalik, Emin Gun Sirer, others: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxeeQ_-QVNo
* Nice thread with resources https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9xasgg/bitcoin_cash_hard_fork_mega_thread/
* Poloniex [allowed](https://poloniex.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/1000270700-update-on-the-upcoming-bitcoin-cash-hard-fork) users to trade betwen both possible outcomes of the Bitcoin Cash fork. This led to the presence of _three_ tokens on the exchange: BCH, BCHABC nad BCHSV, with the latter two being 90% cheaper than BCH. Forks just keep spawning when you don't have a formal process to resolve disputes.
* It appears some forces are tearing apart Bitcoin Cash. Whatever they are, let us keep Decred resistant to them.
* contrast with how Decred works

RChain community's is going through [internal conflicts](https://joshyorndorff.com/blog/keeping-the-rchain-community-together). {what is the source of controversy?} This is not the first internal conflict for RChain, since it itself was born out of a disagreement inside Synereo project which has led to a split in the past.

Looking at many fighting in other communities I (@bee) can't help but insert a personal comment. It appears to me that communities waste a ton of energy on all the controversies. This energy is not building value. Chain splits and community splits leave both sides with less people, less talent, and less chances to make any long term impact. It is ironic that in a space of programmed decentralized consensus systems so many people fail to come to human consensus. Decred manages to keep moving at its decent speed because it avoids external, and more importantly, internal conflicts. Let us keep incentives aligned and keep the community together. {ok or move to own blog?}

UK government canceled a stablecoin project based on a fork of btcd. [@alexbosworth] [noted](https://twitter.com/alexbosworth/status/1056318062176145414): "The thing about stablecoins is that one day someone can come along and cancel the whole thing.".

> @andy_bromberg and @msantoriESQ discuss why ICOs are down 90% since the winter, why airdrops could be a better than ICOs for seeding usage on networks, whether or not they're legal and which wallets to target.

Regular security reminder: SMS, and relying on mobile operators in general, is bad choice for 2FA. Good to see lawsuits [like this](https://www.coindesk.com/victims-sue-att-t-mobile-over-sim-swap-crypto-hacks/) starting but they won't get your coins back. Speaking even more generally, most smartphones have a [baseband chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseband_processor) and other proprietary parts that nobody really knows what they are doing or how vulnerable they are. Keep your coins safe.
