# {DRAFT} Decred Journal â€“ November 2018

![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover text}")

November was an exciting and productive month for the Decred Project. The community began to reap the benefits of Politeia development with successful live proposal voting. Stakeholders collectively voiced key steering decisions regarding the future of contractor management, public relations, and research all from the comfort of their Decred wallet of choice (Decrediton or Command-Line w/politeiavoter).

The Decred Project organically prepared to scale to support stakeholder vision in November - additional companies and individuals joined the Decred ecosystem while some long term contributors self-organized according to interests and abilities.

Amidst the excitement, growth and change in the community, Decred development continued with high levels of activity and progress.

## Development

{per-project summary, drop items without updates}

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): Two big changes started last month were merged after extensive testing. First one is [reversed UTXO set semantics](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1471) and its accompanying [database migration](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1520), an important change that provides simpler and more efficient handling of unspent outputs. A side effect of this is that full block reorganization tests run 40% faster. Second one is [optimized reorganization handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1500). New [--maxsameip](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1517) argument allows to limit the number of connections with the same IP address. A fix to an ultra rare bug was [ported](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1533) from upstream btcd.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): As usage has increased the number of addresses watched by default has become too limited for some and configuration file modification for dcrwallet was required as a workaround. This [address watching issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1320) was fixed for wallets with address beyond the previously default gap limit this month. Additional rare use case fixes included potential [missed or double spent transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1321) and [improvement of locked balance calculations](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1330).

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): To ensure continued cross-platform stability and performance Decrediton was [updated to Electron 3](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1777). Display of the Decred [Treasury balance](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1764) was added. Startup performance of [large wallets](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1727) was improved. Automatic ticket buying was switched to [ticketbuyer v2](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1744). It has fewer options and is simpler to use than v1 thanks to the stabilized ticket prices. Now all the user needs to specify is balance to maintain, account and stakepool to use. Politeia integration saw improvements as well including [more responsive](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1825) proposal loading and [notifications for new proposals and votes](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1835). The UI/UX saw some tuneups this month including [overview design improvements](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1818), updated [account icons](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1811) and improvements to the [navigation icons and microanimations](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1809). The features mentioned were merged into the master branch and will be available in the next release of Decrediton.

Trezor: Model T firmware version 2.0.9 was [released](https://blog.trezor.io/firmware-updates-2-0-9-and-1-7-1-developed-by-the-community-for-the-community-c4b965741ca3) with Decred support. Cheers @matheusd for making it happen! Now our Decrediton developers can work on the integration.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): A [small vulnerability](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/563) was patched, thanks to @iemlisted for reporting. [politeiavoter](https://github.com/decred/politeia/tree/master/politeiavoter) received privacy improvements {try to find a link}. By popular demand an [email notification system](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/919) was created to support awareness about new proposals and comments {pr 919 mentions comments only, was there another pr for new proposals?}. Verification of cast votes was made possible by the [search by ticket](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/899) feature {verify with devs and clarify that ticket search is client side and tickets are not sent to server to protect privacy}. "Finished" tab was [split](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/904) into "Approved" and "Rejected" tabs. Note that some of these features will be available on the [mainnet site](https://proposals.decred.org/) after the next deployment.

[Two](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/613) [steps](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/906) completed towards the feature to [view diffs](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/754) between proposal revisions. Work started to add [highlighting new comments](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/897).

[Android](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): Development of the Decred Wallet for Android made a leap forward this month with a pre-release version available on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.mainnet).  The Play Store version includes updated currency conversion that shows [fee in local currency](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/192) and [advanced password protection](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/134) with the ability to [lock all data](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/187) and to use an [access pin code](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/180). This version also includes a security menu which allows users to [sign messages](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/226) proving ownership of addresses. Another community sourced innovation successfully implemented is the ["Hidden Account" feature](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/175).  Hidden accounts allow mobile users to keep funds in their mobile wallet which will not be displayed on the main screen balance total.  Community members buying and selling Decred at local meetups are excited for the added privacy and security this feature offers.  Fund transfer between accounts also got an upgrade this month with simple [dropdown selection](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/119) ensuring balance changes are quick and easy.

[iOS](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): The iOS Mobile Wallet is currently in beta testing and will require additonal development cycles to incorporate the feature set available on Android.

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): New features integrated into the codebase this month include a [network hashrate chart](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/723), the addition of the [Decred Treasury](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/784) to nav menu and more detailed transaction information like showing that [tx output is spent in mempool](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/825), [tx type on address view](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/741) and improved [timestamp information](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/776).

Preview of the [new home page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/718), along with all new features is available on the [alpha site](https://alpha.dcrdata.org/nexthome) which runs v3.2.0-pre built from master. A more stable [beta site](https://beta.dcrdata.org/) runs v3.1.0-beta. The most stable [explorer.dcrdata.org](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/) runs v3.0.2-release. For consistency with Insight links, the latter is also accessible at [mainnet.dcrdata.org](https://mainnet.dcrdata.org/).

On the dev side, @gozart [started](https://matrix.to/#/!LmKzrmxJIXNHNiEmIh:decred.org/$154214092215095eeuIR:decred.org) an epic refactoring effort to [convert](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/805) javascript codebase to ES6 modules, add webpack for front end dev tooling and production asset bundling, enforce code style and convert CSS to [SCSS partials](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/839).

[dcrstakepool](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool): this is the software used by most, if not all VSPs. The README document was [updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/285) with build instructions for Go modules. Transaction links were changed from Insight to [dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/264).

Several privacy issues were discovered and discussed. A patch is being tested to replace Google recaptcha with [self-hosted CAPTCHA](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/281) to avoid fingerprinting of stakeholders. VSP operators are welcome to join testing. Request to Cloudflare [was removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/283). An issue to [make email optional](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/274) was raised.

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): The Ticket Splitting Beta continued to grow during November with split tickets filled daily. Two VSPs that integrated ticket splitting, [decredbrasil.com](https://stake.decredbrasil.com/) and [decredvoting.com](https://decredvoting.com/), released educational [walk-through video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGoUQK0g24) in Portuguese and English and a general [ticket splitting overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9vhpby/decred_ticket_splitting_overview/), in addition to guides on their sites. The software was updated to support SPV light mode. Please read the [issue](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/issues/29) to consider privacy implications.

Ticket splitting support groups exist both on the [Decred Slack](https://decred.slack.com) and in the [Telegram Group](https://t.me/dcrticketsplit) where [VSP agnostic instructions](https://t.me/dcrticketsplit/2666) are availble.

[design](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign): Kyle at [Firethought](https://firethought.net/) announced a [Decred icon motion pack](https://medium.com/@firethought/base-iconset18-motion-pack-readme-a96f96e868) which promises to bring "more engaging Decred application experiences" and builds on the icon pack designed by [eeter.co](http://www.eeter.co/).

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): November was a huge month for documentation with a variety of community supported changes and updates.  The [VSP change language proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/522652954ea7998f3fca95b9c4ca8907820eb785877dcf7fba92307131818c75) passed which confirmed a community desire to change "PoS Mining" to "PoS Voting", and from "stakepool" to "Voting Service Provider (VSP)" in all Decred documentation.  Updates included [changes to general documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/590) and to the [stakepool page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/724). Updates were made to [adopt the term "Decred Treasury"](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/690) for the special address that holds funds coming from the 10% of the block rewards {better wording possible}. For those looking to take a deeper dive into Politeia a new [Navigating Politeia Data](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/navigating-politeia-data/) advanced document was created. The often requested and long awaited [Decred Glossary](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/675) was completed and published this month in part due to a huge effort by @s_ben and many people who supported the work with feedback and suggestions. We highly recommend utilizing [the glossary](https://docs.decred.org/glossary/) to improve our shared community understanding.

Part of November was reported in the previous issue due to late release.

@snr01 provided nice charts. Multiple people started hacking on Politeia data in #proposals and #research.

Low quality proposals cluttering Politeia were discussed in depth and multiple ideas were suggested. @richardred gave a nice overview of this in Politeia Digest #4.

## Network

Hashrate: November's hashrate opened at around 156 PH/s and closed around 159 PH/s, reaching the low of ca. 125 PH/s and high of ca. 234 PH/s in between. BeePool's share varied between 19-30%, F2Pool 15-46%, Luxor 1.6-4%, and Coinmine 1.9-4%. Unknown hashrate stayed between 25-50% with lows of 15% and spikes to 75%. Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Staking: {30-day average tix price, low, high, locked DCR million and % of avail supply}

## Mining

The Whatsminer D1 [turned out](https://twitter.com/Pangolinminer/status/1061521332498624512) to be 48 TH/s, 9% up from expected 44 TH/s. The price is $4,850 [from Pangolin](https://pangolinminer.com/product/whatsminer-dcr-with-psu-shipout-on-dec-5/). The shipment delay and changes to price and performance drew [varied opinions](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5068845.msg47865706#msg47865706) from the community about best practices and [confusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9fdz9d/psa_do_not_purchase_the_whatsminer_44th_decred/) about the distribution network and what constitutes an official reseller.
Competitor Bitmain announced the Decred [Antminer DR5](https://shop.bitmain.com.cn/product/detail?pid=0002018111918225889369SR3N9s0646) with 34 TH/s at 1800 W, price CNY 19,000 (USD 2750), shipping late December.

## Markets

{markets overview: USD and BTC prices, highs and lows, interesting events, interesting analysis}

Nov 14-15 BTC drop, most top 100 cryptoassets lost 10-20% together with the BTC dive to 5400 USDT / 5200 USD. This happened just a day before the BCH split.

The Media [believes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-16/crypto-winter-comes-early-as-bitcoin-slide-spurs-viability-fears) the BTC dump was sparked by some pump for Bitcoin Cash fork, citing fear, uncertainty and doubt of some guys.

Nov 19-20 bloody day, BTC down to $4300 {right?}, DCR down to $22.

{PoW, ASIC resistance, tech}

Nvidia [reported](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nvidia-q3-results-reveal-crypto-hangover-due-to-disappearance-of-miner-sales) a drop in GPU sales for mining. This must have had nothing to do with Ethereum, Zcash and others receiving ASICs for their GPU-oriented mining algorithms, but rather "it is really the canary in the coal mine for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies" per [the experts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-16/crypto-winter-comes-early-as-bitcoin-slide-spurs-viability-fears). Seriously guys, it is the [collapse](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-15/nvidia-gives-weak-forecast-citing-inventory-stock-slumps) of cryptocurrency mining.

Ethereum Foundation is funding [efforts](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-foundation-filecoin-back-plan-to-make-proof-of-stake-hardware) to create ASICs that compute [Verifiable Delay Function](https://vdfresearch.org/) (VDF) as a replacement for Proof-of-Work mining for blockchain security. [This article](https://medium.com/@djrtwo/vdfs-are-not-proof-of-work-91ba3bec2bf4) compares VDF and Proof-of-Work.

According to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9sq0jj/shady_behavior_from_groestlcoin_grs_developers/), yet another coin with claimed ASIC resistance received an ASIC while the developers removed ASIC resistance claims from the website. Reddit thread that questioned this was [wiped out](https://archive.today/SzoHs). An instance where transparent censorship is missing. (_missed in Oct issue_)

A paper was [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0321-8) in Nature Climate journal that suggests Bitcoin PoW mining will have significant negative impact on climate change. [Discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!NKtIRqGOEGaZvSQkKl:decred.org/$15412120277994HzToF:decred.org) in #random noted serious misunderstandings of how PoW works and alarmingly low quality of the paper, along with some guesses about who and why could have posted it.

Zcash is [looking into](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/announcing-zcash-blossom-and-proposed-feature-goals/31891) hybrid ASIC-GPU mining, among other improvements planned for next year's protocol upgrade.

{governance, forks}

Bitcoin Cash, born as a solution to the long-running Bitcoin scaling debate, itself had a contentious hard fork this month. This [article](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/when-fork-forks-what-you-need-know-bitcoin-cash-goes-war/) has a good summary of what the fork was about. The sides came to be referred to by their dominant software implementation, Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision. BCH ABC was planning a hard fork to add canonical transaction ordering and a new OP code - BCH SV rejects these changes and plans instead to return to a set of rules based on Bitcoin version 0.1.0. 

Miners and oracles seemed to be split relatively evenly between the two sides, with Roger Ver and Jihan Wu on the ABC side and Craig S Wright and Calvin Ayre on the BCH SV side. This contentious hard fork was even more contentious than most, as the BCH SV side announced that they would nullify the replay protection added by ABC (another [good article](https://medium.com/circle-research/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-report-4e4377d514a) about the run-up to the fork). SV actually planned to mitigate ABC's replay protection by allowing miners to collect any BCH transferred using the new ABC OP codes - so that the use of these new features would result in the loss of BCH on the SV chain. There were also threats to attack the ABC chain and kill it, or make it unusable for long periods, should the SV chain have sufficient hashpower. 

This [post on /r/btc](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9xasgg/bitcoin_cash_hard_fork_mega_thread/) compiled a list of resources for following the fork as it played out. The [cash.coin.dance](https://cash.coin.dance/) site has a number of tools for keeping track of the fork in real-time. This [article](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/one-day-after-bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-takeaways-and-latest-developments/) has a good report from 24 hours after the fork. @richard-red has written a short perspective on this [Hash War Theatre](https://medium.com/@richardred/hash-war-theater-67d3fcac3e97) also. On Nov 26 the SV side backed off and declared that the hash war was [over](https://coingeek.com/original-bitcoin-reborn-bitcoin-sv-bsv-bch-hash-war-ends/), they would allow both chains to co-exist in peace. With both chains seemingly being allowed to co-exist by the balance of mining power, it seems like the costs in this case are to be expressed primarily in terms of community fragmentation and aggravation. The BCH community in this case did not really have a role to play or way to affect the outcome, it was one for the miners to hash out.

Feels good to have Decred tickets that can be used to prevent sustained contentious chain splits, and to punish miners who turn the chain into a vehicle for their own power plays, should that ever become a problem.

This month also saw the launch of [SharkPool](https://www.ccn.com/war-bitcoin-cash-startup-launches-mining-pool-to-attack-altcoins-bch-forks/), a startup which aims to attack other Bitcoin forked chains by mining empty blocks and selling the profits for BCH.

There appears to be some drama in the RChain community, involving people being laid off and a possible fork. It is difficult to find any sources about this beyond this [blog post](https://joshyorndorff.com/blog/keeping-the-rchain-community-together).  This is not the first internal conflict for RChain, since it itself was born out of a disagreement inside Synereo project which has led to a split in the past. {#governance link}

Looking at many fighting in other communities I (@bee) can't help but insert a personal comment. It appears to me that communities waste a ton of energy on all the controversies. This energy is not building value. Chain splits and community splits leave both sides with less people, less talent, and less chances to make any long term impact. It is ironic that in a space of programmed decentralized consensus systems so many people fail to come to human consensus. Decred manages to keep moving at its decent speed because it avoids external, and more importantly, internal conflicts. Let us keep incentives aligned and keep the community together. {ok or move to own blog?}

Aragon [released](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-06-is-live-on-mainnet/) a new version on October 30 which allows users to create organizations on the Ethereum mainnet. Prior to this, 15,000+ organizations had apparently been created through previous versions on Ethereum testnets. Aragon can be used to create an "organization", add members and assign them tokens, and then hold signal votes with those tokens. The Aragon community also recently voted [overwhelmingly](https://twitter.com/AragonProject/status/1063590019749855237) (99.97%!) to approve [AGP-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aragon/AGPs/8c945258fc58c842752a49946514815a4fdd971d/AGPs/AGP-1.md), a Governance Proposal Process.

The [NavCoin community fund](https://navcoin.org/en/community-fund/) [launched](https://medium.com/@NAVCoin/community-fund-activated-edc72207a0c0) on Nov 16. Navcoin's community fund operates on "Dual-vote consensus", with an initial vote to decide if a proposal is approved or not, and then a subsequent vote to determine whether the payout should be made (after the work is done). Voters are participants in NavCoin staking, and vote with the weight of their stake. The Navcoin community fund receives 0.25 from each block minted, 500k Nav per year, or around $93k at today's prices. NavCoin proposal voting lasts for one week and requires participation of 50% of stakers, with 70% approval required for acceptance.

Regular security reminder: SMS, and relying on mobile operators in general, is bad choice for 2FA.
