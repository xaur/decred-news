# {DRAFT} Decred Journal â€“ November 2018

![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover text}")

November was an exciting and productive month for the Decred Project. The community began to reap the benefits of Politeia development with successful live proposal voting. Stakeholders collectively voiced key steering decisions regarding the future of contractor management, public relations, and research all from the comfort of their Decred wallet of choice (Decrediton or Command-Line w/politeiavoter).

The Decred Project organically prepared to scale to support stakeholder vision in November - additional companies and individuals joined the Decred ecosystem while some long term contributors self-organized according to interests and abilities.

Amidst the excitement, growth and change in the community, Decred development continued with high levels of activity and progress.

## Development

{per-project summary, drop items without updates}

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): [Reversed UTXO set semantics](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1471) was merged, an important change that provides simpler and more efficient handling of unspent outputs. A side effect of this is that full block reorganization tests run 40% faster. An accompanying [database migration](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1520) is merged and will be added in the next major release.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): As usage has increased the number of addresses watched by default has become too limited for some and configuration file modification for dcrwallet was required as a workaround. This [address watching issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1320) was fixed by default this month. Additional rare use case fixes included potential [missed or double spent transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1321) and [improvement of locked balance calculations](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1330).

* {not clear from pr 1320 that it has something to do with config defaults or config file}

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): To ensure continued cross-platform stability and performance Decrediton was [updated to Electron 3](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1777). Display of the Decred [Treasury balance](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1764) was added. Startup performance of [large wallets](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1727) was improved. Automatic ticket buying was switched to [ticketbuyer v2](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1744). It has fewer options and is simpler to use than v1 thanks to the stabilized ticket prices. Now all the user needs to specify is balance to maintain, account and stakepool to use. Politeia integration saw improvements as well including [more responsive](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1825) proposal loading and [notifications for new proposals and votes](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1835). The UI/UX saw some tuneups this month including [overview design improvements](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1818), updated [account icons](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1811) and improvements to the [navigation icons and microanimations](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1809). The features mentioned were merged into the master branch and will be available in the next release of Decrediton.

Trezor: Model T firmware version 2.0.9 was [released](https://blog.trezor.io/firmware-updates-2-0-9-and-1-7-1-developed-by-the-community-for-the-community-c4b965741ca3) with Decred support. Cheers @matheusd for making it happen! Now our Decrediton developers can work on the integration.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): A [small vulnerability](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/563) was patched, thanks to @iemlisted for reporting. [politeiavoter](https://github.com/decred/politeia/tree/master/politeiavoter) received privacy improvements {try to find a link}. By popular demand an [email notification system](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/919) was created to support awareness about new proposals and comments {pr 919 mentions comments only, was there another pr for new proposals?}. Verification of cast votes was made possible by the [search by ticket](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/899) feature {verify with devs and clarify that ticket search is client side and tickets are not sent to server to protect privacy}. "Finished" tab was [split](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/904) into "Approved" and "Rejected" tabs. Note that some of these features will be available on the [mainnet site](https://proposals.decred.org/) after the next deployment.

[Two](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/613) [steps](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/906) completed towards the feature to [view diffs](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/754) between proposal revisions. Work started to add [highlighting new comments](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/897).

[Android](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): Development of the Decred Wallet for Android made a leap forward this month with a pre-release version available on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.mainnet).  The Play Store version includes updated currency conversion that shows [fee in local currency](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/192) and [advanced password protection](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/134) with the ability to [lock all data](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/187) and to use an [access pin code](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/180). This version also includes a security menu which allows users to [sign messages](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/226) proving ownership of addresses. Another community sourced innovation successfully implemented is the ["Hidden Account" feature](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/175).  Hidden accounts allow mobile users to keep funds in their mobile wallet which will not be displayed on the main screen balance total.  Community members buying and selling Decred at local meetups are excited for the added privacy and security this feature offers.  Fund transfer between accounts also got an upgrade this month with simple [dropdown selection](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/119) ensuring balance changes are quick and easy.

[iOS](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): The iOS Mobile Wallet is currently in beta testing and will require additonal development cycles to incorporate the feature set available on Android.

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): New features integrated into the base code this month include a [network hashrate chart](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/723), the addition of the [Decred Treasury](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/784) to nav menu and more detailed transaction information like showing that [tx output is spent in mempool](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/825), [tx type on address view](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/741) and improved [timestamp information](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/776).

On the dev side, @gozart started an epic refactoring effort to [convert](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/805) javascript codebase to ES6 modules, add webpack for front end dev tooling and production asset bundling, enforce code style and convert CSS to [SCSS partials](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/839).

[dcrstakepool](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool): this is the software used by most, if not all VSPs. The README document was [updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/285) with build instructions for Go modules. Transaction links were changed from Insight to [dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/264).

Several privacy issues were discovered and discussed. A patch is being tested to replace Google recaptcha with [self-hosted CAPTCHA](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/281) to avoid fingerprinting of stakeholders. VSP operators are welcome to join testing. Request to Cloudflare [was removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/283). An issue to [make email optional](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/274) was raised.

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): The Ticket Splitting Beta continued to grow during November with split tickets filled daily. Two VSPs that integrated ticket splitting, [decredbrasil.com](https://stake.decredbrasil.com/) and [decredvoting.com](https://decredvoting.com/), released educational [walk-through video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGoUQK0g24) in Portuguese and English and a general [ticket splitting overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9vhpby/decred_ticket_splitting_overview/), in addition to guides on their sites. The software was updated to support SPV light mode. Please read the [issue](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/issues/29) to consider privacy implications.

Ticket splitting support groups exist both on the [Decred Slack](https://decred.slack.com) and in the [Telegram Group](https://t.me/dcrticketsplit) where [VSP agnostic instructions](https://t.me/dcrticketsplit/2666) are availble.

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): November was a huge month for documentation with a variety of community supported changes and updates.  The [VSP change language proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/522652954ea7998f3fca95b9c4ca8907820eb785877dcf7fba92307131818c75) passed which confirmed a community desire to change "PoS Mining" to "PoS Voting", and from "stakepool" to "Voting Service Provider (VSP)" in all Decred documentation.  Updates included [changes to general documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/590) and to the [stakepool page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/724). Updates were made to [adopt the term "Decred Treasury"](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/690) for the special address that holds funds coming from the 10% of the block rewards {better wording possible}. For those looking to take a deeper dive into Politeia a new [Navigating Politeia Data](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/navigating-politeia-data/) advanced document was created. The often requested and long awaited [Decred Glossary](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/675) was completed and published this month in part due to a huge effort by @s_ben and many people who supported the work with feedback and suggestions.  We highly recommend utilizing [the glossary](https://docs.decred.org/glossary/) to improve our shared community understanding.

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb):

* Rename stake "mining" to "voting", "stakepool" to "VSP" https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/435

## Governance

{recap of decision-making activity, including new proposals, changes to proposals, voting, discussions, pre-proposal drafts, etc}

Part of November was reported in the previous issue due to late release.

@snr01 provided nice charts. Multiple people started hacking on Politeia data in #proposals and #research.

Low quality proposals cluttering Politeia were discussed in depth and multiple ideas were suggested. @richardred gave a nice overview of this in Politeia Digest #4.

## Network

Hashrate: November's hashrate opened at around 156 PH/s and closed around 159 PH/s, reaching the low of ca. 125 PH/s and high of ca. 234 PH/s in between. BeePool's share varied between 19-30%, F2Pool 15-46%, Luxor 1.6-4%, and Coinmine 1.9-4%. Unknown hashrate stayed between 25-50% with lows of 15% and spikes to 75%. Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Staking: {30-day average tix price, low, high, locked DCR million and % of avail supply}

After the price dropped to 97.1, 1,378 tickets were purchased in a single window that bumped the price to 110.2 after 9 subsequent price increases. This is the new all time high on new sdiff algorithm that has been in effect since July 2017.

## Mining

The Whatsminer D1 [turned out](https://twitter.com/Pangolinminer/status/1061521332498624512) to be 48 TH/s, 9% up from expected 44 TH/s. The price is $4,850 [from Pangolin](https://pangolinminer.com/product/whatsminer-dcr-with-psu-shipout-on-dec-5/). The shipment delay and changes to price and performance drew [varied opinions](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5068845.msg47865706#msg47865706) from the community about best practices and [confusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9fdz9d/psa_do_not_purchase_the_whatsminer_44th_decred/) about the distribution network and what constitutes an official reseller.
Competitor Bitmain announced the Decred [Antminer DR5](https://shop.bitmain.com.cn/product/detail?pid=0002018111918225889369SR3N9s0646) with 34 TH/s at 1800 W, price CNY 19,000 (USD 2750), shipping late December.

## Markets

{markets overview: USD and BTC prices, highs and lows, interesting events, interesting analysis}

Nov 14-15 BTC drop, most top 100 cryptoassets lost 10-20% together with the BTC dive to 5400 USDT / 5200 USD. This happened just a day before the BCH split.

The Media [believes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-16/crypto-winter-comes-early-as-bitcoin-slide-spurs-viability-fears) the BTC dump was sparked by some pump for Bitcoin Cash fork, citing fear, uncertainty and doubt of some guys.

Nov 19-20 bloody day, BTC down to $4300 {right?}, DCR down to $22.

Nvidia [reported](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nvidia-q3-results-reveal-crypto-hangover-due-to-disappearance-of-miner-sales) a drop in GPU sales for mining. This must have had nothing to do with Ethereum, Zcash and others receiving ASICs for their GPU-oriented mining algorithms, but rather "it is really the canary in the coal mine for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies" per [the experts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-16/crypto-winter-comes-early-as-bitcoin-slide-spurs-viability-fears).

According to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9sq0jj/shady_behavior_from_groestlcoin_grs_developers/), yet another coin with claimed ASIC resistance received an ASIC while the developers removed ASIC resistance claims from the website. Reddit thread that questioned this was [wiped out](https://archive.today/SzoHs). An instance where transparent censorship is missing. (_missed in Oct issue_)

A paper was [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0321-8) in Nature Climate journal that suggests Bitcoin PoW mining will have significant negative impact on climate change. [Discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!NKtIRqGOEGaZvSQkKl:decred.org/$15412120277994HzToF:decred.org) in #random noted serious misunderstandings of how PoW works and alarmingly low quality of the paper, along with some guesses about who and why could have posted it.

Zcash is [looking into](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/announcing-zcash-blossom-and-proposed-feature-goals/31891) hybrid ASIC-GPU mining, among other improvements planned for next year's protocol upgrade.

* Bitcoin Cash, born as a solution to disagreement with Bitcoin, is splitting into 2 chains (correct?). SV = Satoshi's Vision? Again?
* (does the community split or is it a horror story by the media?)
* explain 1) why they are forking, 2) vision and tech behind SV and ABC, 3) people, companies and capital behind both
* what has Cobra to do with it?

* nice overview https://medium.com/circle-research/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-report-4e4377d514a
  * both projects get individually weaker
  * SV is quite aggressive to ABC and hopes to dedicate some hashrate to mining empty blocks on the ABC chain (and not to secure the SV chain)
* nice high-level overview: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/when-fork-forks-what-you-need-know-bitcoin-cash-goes-war/

* Poloniex [allowed](https://poloniex.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/1000270700-update-on-the-upcoming-bitcoin-cash-hard-fork) users to trade betwen both possible outcomes of the Bitcoin Cash fork. This led to the presence of _three_ tokens on the exchange: BCH, BCHABC nad BCHSV, with the latter two being 90% cheaper than BCH. Forks just keep spawning when you don't have a formal process to resolve disputes.
* It appears some forces are tearing apart Bitcoin Cash. Whatever they are, let us keep Decred resistant to them.

* note how coin holders are yet again not asked for what they want, while miners, developers and exchanges, and even miners from other SHA-256 chains (Bitcoin) could influence the outcome.

RChain community's is going through [internal conflicts](https://joshyorndorff.com/blog/keeping-the-rchain-community-together). {what is the source of controversy?} This is not the first internal conflict for RChain, since it itself was born out of a disagreement inside Synereo project which has led to a split in the past. {#governance link}

Looking at many fighting in other communities I (@bee) can't help but insert a personal comment. It appears to me that communities waste a ton of energy on all the controversies. This energy is not building value. Chain splits and community splits leave both sides with less people, less talent, and less chances to make any long term impact. It is ironic that in a space of programmed decentralized consensus systems so many people fail to come to human consensus. Decred manages to keep moving at its decent speed because it avoids external, and more importantly, internal conflicts. Let us keep incentives aligned and keep the community together. {ok or move to own blog?}

UK government canceled a stablecoin project based on a fork of btcd. [@alexbosworth] [noted](https://twitter.com/alexbosworth/status/1056318062176145414): "The thing about stablecoins is that one day someone can come along and cancel the whole thing.".

> @andy_bromberg and @msantoriESQ discuss why ICOs are down 90% since the winter, why airdrops could be a better than ICOs for seeding usage on networks, whether or not they're legal and which wallets to target.

Regular security reminder: SMS, and relying on mobile operators in general, is bad choice for 2FA. Good to see lawsuits [like this](https://www.coindesk.com/victims-sue-att-t-mobile-over-sim-swap-crypto-hacks/) starting but they won't get your coins back. Speaking even more generally, most smartphones have a [baseband chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseband_processor) and other proprietary parts that nobody really knows what they are doing or how vulnerable they are. Keep your coins safe.

Copay wallet was infected with malware to steal cryptocurrency. If you used this wallet or its derivative, you may need to move your coins to a new seed. This [coverage](https://thehackernews.com/2018/11/nodejs-event-stream-module.html) includes details like affected software and versions. The cause was repository compromise of one of the npm dependencies. No known Decred software was affected.
