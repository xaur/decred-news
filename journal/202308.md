<a id="cryptopower-v100-release" />

## Cryptopower v1.0.0 Release

Cryptopower is a new self-custodial wallet for DCR, BTC and LTC. The first public mainnet release packages a year of development work since GoDCR stopped in [August 2022](202208.md#godcr) adding multiple exciting features. Highlights:

- Multi-coin wallet for DCR, BTC and LTC - all working in light (SPV) mode without needing to download full blockchains
- Decred staking, mixing, and governance - voting on consensus changes, treasury spends and Politeia proposals
- Coin conversion via centralized exchangers like [Flyp.me](https://flyp.me/), [Godex.io](https://godex.io/), [ChangeNOW.io](https://changenow.io/) and others
- Custom coin (output) selection for extra privacy { _Note: I would be cautious about saying this is a privacy feature. I think it CAN increase privacy, but it can also be a major footgun. Not sure what I truly think, because I've wanted coin control for so long because of how I think it truly can increase privacy. But anyway, a simple fix would just be to change this to "...for extra control."_ }
- Custom gap limit
- Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD
- Potential to build mobile apps for Android and iOS from the same codebase

<a id="bison-relay-v018-release" />

## Bison Relay v0.1.8 Release

This is a big release with exciting new features and polish from 4 months of development.

Major changes in both GUI and text apps:

- Loading of chat history after app restarts
- Pages with hyperlinks (similar to web pages)
- Improved reliability of key exchanges and tipping
- Numerous bug fixes

GUI app highlights:

- Address book with searching and filtering
- News Feed can now show images and has improved sorting
- Improved notifications UI
- Improved responsiveness on smaller screens

brclient text app highlights:

- Initial e-commerce features
- Client-side content filtering
- Client data backups

The initial e-commerce infrastructure called "simplestore" is designed for selling digital-only goods such as images, videos, audio, and files. Supported payment methods are DCR Lightning Network, on-chain DCR transfers, and custom. Simplestore is only available in the text-based brclient app in this release.

GUI and text clients have different features now. Changes for each app are listed on the [release page](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/releases/tag/v0.1.8), and mind the upgrade notice if migrating from v0.1.7 on Windows. For a complete list of changes with explanations see [Decred Journal](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) issues from April to June 2023. See the [README](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/blob/v0.1.8/README.md#verifying-binaries) file for instructions on verifying the files.

### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

The majority of the work this month was developer-focused, and not necessarily user-focused. However, it's always interesting when a new Go version is supported, because it unlocks potential new features and improvements from the coding language itself (reference the dcrwallet updates from the [July issue](202307.md#dcrwallet) for examples of this).

The following work has been merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Dropped official support for Go 1.19, and [added support for Go 1.21.0](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3172) (Go 1.20 is still supported as well). This included updates to the build and test actions, as well as updating the GitHub Actions build workflow `setup-go` and linter to their latest verisons.
  - { _can clarify what "official support" is, i.e. if building with Go 1.19 still possible (go.mod)_ }
- Updated the [Docker image](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3171) to build the dcrd binary with Go 1.21.0.
- Tidied up the GitHub Actions [build workflow](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3168) to reduce duplicate cache entries and cache spam. This involved removing the Go module and build cache from the GitHub build workflow, since the latest `setup-go` action caches them by default, and this was creating duplicate cache entries. The linter is still cached separately, and this update also included a small filename change to produce significantly fewer cache objects.
- Added a test scenario to the [ASERT tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3173) that ensures the difficulty adjusts appropriately when block times are speeding up.
- Added a [duplicate-word linter](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3175), and used it to [tidy up comments](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3174) in 44 different files.
- [Removed unused parameters](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3177) from a few blockchain functions: `parent` from the internal logger, and `isTreasuryEnabled` from `getStakeBaseAmounts`. These functions are internal, so this change has no impact to clients or users.
- Added an [error linter](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3179), and updated multiple errors so that they can be [wrapped with useful context](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3178). This allows them to be unwrapped by function callers to identify the source of the error. This update allows the errors to work nicely with `errors.Is` and `errors.As`.

The [DCP-11 document](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0011/dcp-0011.mediawiki) specifying the change to BLAKE3 and ASERT has been reviewed and [released](https://github.com/decred/dcps/pull/29), here are some interesting facts we found:

- The document explains the new proof of work hash, new ASERT difficulty adjustment algorithm, and the difficulty reset at the activation block, all in great detail with formulas, diagrams, and guidance for implementations.
- *Block header* stays { _should these verbs be in present active tense? Stays, remains, changes, is executed... I agree with "The document explains...", but it seems like some of these should be "stayed, remained, changed..."_ } exactly the same; it is a compact 180-byte structure that holds important metadata about the block and allows to sync and navigate the chain very quickly.
- *Block hash* remains unchanged too; it is the same BLAKE-256 14-round hash of the *block header*. Most Decred software and code uses block hash to identify blocks and needs no modifications.
- *Proof of work hash* changes to BLAKE3; it is created by hashing the *block header*. Only mining software (and hardware) needs to adapt to this new hashing algorithm.
- Research into difficulty algorithms has shown that ASERT is one of the [best performers](https://github.com/zawy12/difficulty-algorithms/issues/50). Side note: Bitcoin's DA got the worst rating in the last 9th category after all others. Based on that and other research Bitcoin Cash [adopted](https://documentation.cash/protocol/forks/2020-11-15-asert.html) a variation of ASERT in November 2020.
- A new ASERT difficulty must be calculated for every block, which is 144x more frequent than the previous EMA algorithm. However, the ASERT algorithm can be calculated ~16x faster, so overall dcrd will spend ~9x more time running ASERT code. However, this is on the order of microseconds per block and does not make any practical difference. Read more [here](https://github.com/decred/dcps/pull/29#discussion_r1300314310).
- DCP-11 is the biggest DCP so far, when measuring by the length of text, file count and overall size. It is very well made and all Decred enthusiasts are advised to [read the full thing](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0011/dcp-0011.mediawiki).

Voting results subsection has been added to all 12 [DCP documents](https://github.com/decred/dcps) to document at which historical blocks the voting started as well as when consensus changes locked in and activated. Implementations of Decred consensus may use these block numbers to optimize their chain verification logic and avoid tallying historical votes.

### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

June-July changes [backported](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2277) for the next v1.8.x release:

- [Warn users](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commit/1c1bcfbd5aa7ca0b1cbad06b4f1bb6b8c2af5aa5) about VSP fee payment errors caused by the wallet being locked. This will allow users to react if a locked wallet blocks VSP fee payments. Upon seeing the error, the user should unlock the wallet and try again to prevent missed tickets.
- Fixed broken [retrying logic](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commit/07854e3746aeef2de88488ae5cc87ee6a092387b) for errored VSP ticket purchases. This issue affected many users. Any ticket purchases which worked first time were unaffected, but any purchases which ran into an error were not being retried, which would lead to tickets not being added to the VSP and votes being missed. Thankfully, re-registering the ticket with a different VSP was a workaround, but obviously it was poor UX.
- Fixed a bug where the [fee payment status check](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commit/c4c6c4213da7cde5ecdc97fb5347a1c7bc3aeae2) could be unreasonably delayed. The VSP client delays actions by some random duration in order to help protect privacy. With this incorrect delay calculation the wallet would report fee payments as being unconfirmed for up to 2 hours until the next check happens, when actually the fee has been sent and confirmed. Now the user wallet will update sooner.
- Require VSP clients to [wait for the VSP to confirm fee payments](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commit/7c551ce6b95456b6ec1a174b5529641dd133230a) before considering a VSP ticket fully purchased. This eliminates multiple problematic edge cases caused by users broadcasting their own fee transactions, such as paying too low of a fee or sending payment to the wrong address. It is a preventative fix for extremely unlikely cases which have not been seen in the wild.

New changes merged in `master` and backported for the next v1.8.x release:

- Fixed a bug where ticket purchase transactions could be sent to the VSP client before they were mined, resulting in the VSP not [calculating the block heights](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2270) where the ticket would be live/expired. Without knowing if the ticket was live or expired, the VSP wouldn't vote on the ticket, and would result in a missed ticket. Backported change is [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commit/1319da0b05d4a9715b045e847ff58b442f407f39).
  - { _@jholdstock, is this true? What happened previously when `fp.ticketLive == 0` or `fp.ticketExpires == 0`? I can't figure out exactly what users would experience. Also, how often would unmined transactions reach the VSP? Seems like since the mempool travels faster than blocks, it would happen quite a lot, but VSPs don't miss many tickets._ }

The following work has been merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Added [logging of transaction changes the wallet notices](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2275) during rescans. This is off during the initial rescan (during reseed or after restarting dcrwallet) because it would be too noisy. Any other rescans are typically done to fix a problem, and during them dcrwallet will log when it finds new wallet transactions inside an old block, or wallet transactions which were previously unmined, but are now mined. Rescans aren't fun for users, and rescans are really just a bandaid to sync wallets that got out of sync and missed a transaction. Having the hashes of missed transactions will be helpful to debug why a wallet had a problem syncing them, and will hopefully result in some bugfixes that reduce user's need to rescan. {_user_}
- Added a [cancellation check](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2276) to non-mixed ticket purchases before publishing the purchase. Mixed ticket purchases already check for cancellation, so this may solve an edge-case bug. {_user_}
- Fixed some error-handling logic and added new error logs if processing VSP tickets fails. Also moved the logic of [finding VSP-managed tickets](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2259) out of the VSP client and into the main wallet code. This is part of the continued effort to refactor VSP and wallet logic. {_user_}
  - { _what bugs were experienced by end users when `NotExist` errors were handled incorrectly?_ }
- Added official [support for Go 1.21](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2278) and updated the GitHub Actions workflow to the latest `setup-go` and `checkout` verisons. {_user_}
- [Replaced](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2265) all non-generated uses of `interface{}` with `any` in the codebase. Both of these items are just a type alias, and are therefore fairly interchangeable and equivalent. However, `any` does have at least one advantage which can help developers avoid a tricky bug. If two variables of type `interface{}` are used in a function argument, they can potentially end up as two different types. However, if two variables of type `any` are used in a function argument, they're enforced to have the same type each. For this reason, `any` is the safer type to use. {_dev_}
- Updated the interal tool used to automatically generate gRPC files to use a [newer Docker image](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2280) with the latest Go 1.21.0 version. {_dev_}


### dcrctl

_[dcrctl](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl) is a command-line client for dcrd and dcrwallet._

- Improved instructions for setting up [environment variables](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/pull/68).
- Updated CI and docs for [Go 1.21](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/pull/69).


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

Packaging contributions:

- Decrediton v1.8.0 has been added to [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pull/149083) repository for macOS users.
- Decrediton v1.8.0 has been added to [winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/pull/112385), a package manager installed by default in Windows 10 and 11.

Other news:

- [Decrediton 2FA](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/15cyod5/decrediton_2fa_hoddle_safely/) concept from @norwnd seems to have been put [on hold](https://matrix.to/#/!DwNysKhaQPBPURaBGt:decred.org/$sn4rEGvdxLgITmVuwLrFXfQhPXbVqvMVkK1So_xa2DY) in favor of exploring a general-purpose [multisig solution](https://gist.github.com/norwnd/890ad642985f4e9e9f7b1dd243b21f9e#long-term-we-need-decrediton-with-generic-multisig-support-right-) for Decrediton if there is demand. Currently there is no GUI for multisig in Decred.


### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software used by Voting Service Providers. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

Developer and internal changes:

- Tuned [.gitignore](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/405) { _may group (minor)_ }
- Added test to ensure the hard-coded [error string](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/404) returned from [securecookie](https://github.com/gorilla/securecookie) will not change unexpectedly when vspd is upgraded to a newer version of the library.
- [Replaced](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/401) use of `interface{}` with `any`, similar to [dcrwallet](#dcrwallet).
- Updated to [Go 1.21](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/402) and newer GitHub Actions. Testing with Go 1.19 has been removed.
- Removed client-side [VSP fee payment logic](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/403) from vspd repository. The [idea](https://github.com/decred/vspd/issues/379) to migrate all VSP client code from dcrwallet to vspd repository was found to be problematic, it created a circular dependency between vspd and dcrwallet which is [cumbersome](https://matrix.to/#/!zefvTnlxYHPKvJMThI:decred.org/$_rzNyvnGedWeh_tnXWk5WDQKaj3TODeXbxRa9fg7CtY) and not worth the maintence burden. Most VSP client code has been removed from vspd and will continue to live in dcrwallet repository. Eventually it should become an exported package so that other software could use it to add Decred staking features.
  - { _^ is it correct? What client VSP code remains in vspd then? And which module consumers like DEX or Cryptopower should consume now to not copy-paste dcrwallet's VSP code?_ }
- Wait until all other startup tasks have been completed before listening to [notifications from dcrd](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/407). There was no problem with connecting to dcrd earlier but it was unnecessary and created messy logs.
- Simplified [shutdown code](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/410). It was inherited from dcrwallet and was a bit more flexible and complex than required for vspd.
- Various [refactoring](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/408) to allow more code reuse and improve integrity checks.
- Refactored how [data is passed](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/409) internally to remove duplication and prepare for future changes.
- Moved database integrity checks to a [better place](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/406). { _may group (minor)_ }
- Fixed a bug with processing new block [notifications](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/412) from dcrd (it did not affect any released version).
- Removed [contexts from structs](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/411) as [recommended](https://pkg.go.dev/context) by standard library documentation. Added [linters](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/411) to find this and other issues that come up during code review.
- Changed discovery of [voted and revoked tickets](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/413) from using dcrwallet's `TicketInfo` call to using [dcrd's GCS filters](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/f69247ff2478057ddbbc6692fc96ff6520b6a8c1/gcs). [Golomb-coded Sets](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#user-content-Golombcoded_Sets) (GCS) allow very efficient detection of transactions and it powers Decred's privacy-preserving light wallets (SPV). The new method is [more robust](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/413#issuecomment-1694228745), and as a result VSP admins may notice that vspd detects some historic voted/revoked tickets which `TicketInfo` never detected.
- Added a new integrity check that updates revoked tickets in the database to be either [expired or missed](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/415). Initial version of vspd was unable to distinguish between expired and missed tickets and reported them all as "revoked". Knowing how many tickets were missed by the VSP is useful for [evaluating its reliability](https://github.com/decred/vspd/issues/268). This update uses a clever heuristic to guess ticket outcome based on how long it took to revoke it. It is not 100% correct but is good enough for the purpose of reporting VSP stats.
- Minor changes. { 414, 420 - group or drop after review }


### Lightning Network

_[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant and low-cost transactions._

- Ported changes made in the upstream [lnd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) between v0.11.1 and [v0.12.1](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.12.1-beta) (released Feb 2021). 541 commits distributed across 220 upstream PRs have been ported, of which [53 commits](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/commits?after=c97f63c8bc41977c6c9b6e5b62fb216e8157cef9+0&author=matheusd) were needed to adjust the codebase to Decred. Full list of ported changes can be found [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/blob/master/docs/upstream-prs.csv).


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

DCRDEX v0.6.2 is now available in [Decred's Umbrel app store](https://github.com/decred/umbrel-app-store).

Changes included in the v0.6.3 release (out in September):

- Fixed a possibility of showing incorrect [order book](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2449) in some order cancellation scenarios.

The remaining changes below are merged in the `master` branch towards future releases.

Client:

- Improved [app seed display](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2462) on the backup page, it will be shown in groups of 8 characters.
- Implemented [configuration restrictions](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2454) for wallets controlled externally. This allows to hide settings like password change if the DEX GUI is embedded in Decrediton and the trading wallet is controlled by it, in order to prevent users from breaking the wallet.
- Update browser [tab/window title](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2458) when changing markets. Also provide instant visual feedback when the user clicks on another market, such as clear the depth chart, order book and recent matches.

Server:

- Only send penalize notification when user's [tier changes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2451), avoiding unnecessary notifications.

Decred:

- Added [staking support foundations](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2290) (not yet exposed on the UI). { _bonus: did it intend to downgrade btcsuite deps in root go.mod?_ }
- Exposed staking methods via the [JSON-RPC API](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2316) to be used by the GUI or the dexcctl command-line app.
- Added a method to fetch a [list of Voting Service Providers](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2466) from [api.decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/blob/master/docs/api.md).

Bitcoin:

- Fixed crash when attempting to [reconfigure](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2474) a missing or corrupted BTC wallet.

Dash:

- Added [full node wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2424) support for DASH.
- Require Dash's mandatory [v19.2.0](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2484) update.

Firo:

- Implemented [Electrum light wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2426) support for Firo, including test harnesses with automated Firo's chain daemon, ElectrumX server, and wallet client.

[Market maker and arbitrage bots](https://proposals.decred.org/record/8b1ceda) progress:

- Implemented [balance segregation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2332) which limits the amount of funds available to each bot.
- Implemented [simulation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2409) of sideways, trending, and volatile markets. This will be used to [test bot behavior](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2303). For the curious, available market simulations are documented [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/blob/8fad25372c4af9d0b378335e4a3dbd12f6ba0d22/dex/testing/loadbot/README.md).

### Cryptopower

_[Cryptopower](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower) is a multi-coin desktop GUI wallet for DCR, BTC, and LTC. It runs in the light SPV mode without needing full blockchains, supports Decred staking, mixing, and voting, and other unique features._

Last time we wrote dev logs for this project was in [August 2022](202208.md#godcr), when it was called GoDCR. This August was relatively quiet in terms of development while the team was focused on shipping the initial v1.0.0 release and working on the [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/256efee) to get this project funded.

Changes merged in `master` towards the next release:

- Fixed issues preventing DCR [ticket purchasing](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/44). Opening ticket details will resubmit the VSP fee if it failed. Added the VSP fee amount to the ticket details page.
- Fixed app crash when clicking on the [Vote button](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/54) to vote on a proposal.

[instantswap](https://github.com/crypto-power/instantswap) library:

- Added a function to verify that an [address has received](https://github.com/crypto-power/instantswap/pull/5) the specified amount.
- Cryptopower wallet uses the instantswap library to convert between coins through centralized services like Flyp.me, Godex.io, ChangeNOW.io, [and more](https://github.com/crypto-power/instantswap/tree/a58863beed9541e9cfefce611b2a3392ef0a9c1d/instantswap). It also provides utilities for inspecting addresses and transactions via different [block explorers](https://github.com/crypto-power/instantswap/tree/a58863beed9541e9cfefce611b2a3392ef0a9c1d/blockexplorer).

{ _maybe add dev history recap_ }

The plan from here is to fix bugs found in the initial release, and build the features outlined in the [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/256efee) while reusing as much as possible from DCRDEX and other Decred projects.

Developers and testers interested to contribute can join the #cryptopower and #cryptopower-dev chat rooms. See [this guide](https://docs.decred.org/getting-started/joining-matrix-channels/) for how to join our Matrix chats.

### Documentation

_[dcrdocs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs) is the source code for Decred [user documentation](https://docs.decred.org/)._

- Several pages have been updated for [DCP-12](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1226). [Overview](https://docs.decred.org/), [Glossary](https://docs.decred.org/glossary/), and [Constitution](https://docs.decred.org/governance/decred-constitution/) pages now have correct block reward split. Additionally, [Issuance](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/issuance/) page documents all three historical splits (60/30/10, 10/80/10, and 1/89/10), and has an updated issuance chart.
- Updated [Material theme for MkDocs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1227) to v9.2.6, which adds new validation for internal links and navigation menu items. There was an [issue](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/5924) with one plugin but the maintainer has fixed it and released the fixed version in just one day.

> Taking into account the initial block reward splits for the first 794,367 blocks and the modified split starting with block 794,368, the effective final split of the total mined coins is:
> 
> * 40.34% to PoW miners
> * 49.63% to PoS voters
> * 10% to the Decred Treasury \[[DCR Issuance](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/issuance/)\]


### decred.org

_[dcrweb](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb) is the source code for the [decred.org](https://decred.org/) website._

- Added [brand icons](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1132) to software releases on the [News](https://decred.org/news/) page
- Added [13 items](https://decred.org/news/) to the News page


### Bison Relay

_[Bison Relay](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay) is a new social media platform with strong protections against censorship, surveillance, and advertising, powered by Decred Lightning Network._

Common changes in the GUI app and text-based brclient in v0.1.8 release:

- [Recognize `lnpay://` links](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/commit/66ebc67b02d758594bf86bf640c8f66d9f409fe5) and display them as buttons that can initiate LN payments.
- Added [release notes](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/313), hashes and signatures for v0.1.8 release. This also adds instructions on verifying the files to repository's README file.
- Skip buggy [amount checks](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/309) in dcrlnd until they are fixed. These checks may prevent the client from sending messages.

GUI app changes included in v0.1.8 release:

- Bison Relay's data directory on Windows will be [moved to a new location](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/307) due to issues with MSIX and an updated certificate. The user will be shown a warning and advised to make a backup before proceeding.
- Added [documentation](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/311) about conviguring simplestore.
- List [active chats](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/320) in the address book. Previously, if a chat is already open it would not be shown in the address book and users could be confused that some contacts are missing.
- Fixed [app name](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/322) shown in Windows Task Manager.
- Minor fixes. { 310 }

brclient changes included in v0.1.8 release:

- Added [tracking of simplestore payments](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/303) via LN invoices and on-chain DCR transactions. Added ability to send the purchased file after the payment is confirmed.
- Fixed possibility of parsing wrong files when [loading products](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/commit/57c8d48a2ad7cf8a88208e9d89c9e952bab13ae0).

Changes listed below have been merged in `master` towards future releases.

Common changes in the GUI app and text-based brclient:

- Automatically unsubscribe idle users and remove them from group chats. If a peer user is idle for 21 days an automatic handshake is sent to test if it will respond. After 60 days, if there is still no response, idle peer is forcibly unsubscribed from local user's posts and removed from any group chats where the local user is the admin. Both time intervals can be configured or disabled by the user.

GUI app changes:

- Fixed [link opening](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/318) returning error instead of opening link in the web browser.
- Minor fixes. { 319 333 }

brclient changes:

- [Generate](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/332) simplestore from the template if the configured store directory exists but is empty. Previously an existing empty directory prevented this.
- [Expand](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/330) environment varibles and `~` in the `/backup` command.

Internal and developer changes:

- Build and test with [Go 1.21](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/315).
- Updated [dependencies](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/312).
- Other changes. { 328 }

In August the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 7,155 DCR worth $99K at August's average rate of $13.89. 5,961 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $83K at same rate.

A [treasury spend tx](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/144c17b0542e4aecb6c2b00b905552b001055dcf8298a0cd8ce0c1409e4bb2e4) was approved with 7,163 Yes votes and 56% turnout, and mined on Aug 28. It had 26 outputs making payments to contractors, ranging from 7 DCR to 2,036 DCR. Most of this DCR was likely paid for June work, at its billing exchange rate of $14.25 the TSpend is worth around $85K.

{ _Other interesting facts/stories about the legacy or new treasury._ }

As of Aug 2, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 865,779 DCR (11.1 million USD at $12.81).

- An article in [The Currency Analytics](https://thecurrencyanalytics.com/crypto-exchanges/revolutionizing-online-shopping-bison-relay-unveils-latest-upgrade-paving-the-way-for-decentralized-e-commerce-67167.php) about the Bison Relay release, including details about the new features and how the upgrade is 'Paving the Way for Decentralized E-commerce.' 

Decred Vanguard Update:

We've slowed down as we try to think about the best ways to navigate through a bear market where interest and volume are considerably lower than normal. While the Vanguard marketing method focuses around trying to talk about Decred *alot*, at this time, we'd prefer to be realistic and remain grounded as we configure new strategies.

[Decred Vanguard](https://proposals.decred.org/record/0a1b782) is always looking for new, eager members to help us promote Decred. The benefits are straightforward - $100 a month in Decred for participation and your Twitter Blue account paid for! Organization is done in a Discord server. If you have any unique ideas for promoting Decred, like making memes, art, or just want to be a contributing member, please contact [@Exitus](https://twitter.com/exitusdcr) or [@Tivra](https://twitter.com/WasPraxis).

I haven't put in the effort to verify any of the address/tx info they're posting or see that it all fits together, and I don't see much consensus that this is the case on X from people who are known for this kind of research. For example [this](https://x.com/BoringSleuth/status/1688292365935718400?s=20) tweet later in the thread has the account sharing a theory that all crypto exchanges are "possibly all just the CCP". From the limited time I spent looking at the account's methods, I wouldn't personally be making this kind of claim based on that kind of evidence, there's a lot of inferences in their foundations and then a lot of stuff built on those shaky inferences.

Coinbase's new Ethereum layer 2 network using the Optimism stack [launched](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/09/coinbase-officially-launches-base-blockchain-milestone-for-a-public-company/), it is called Base. This is the first time a publicly traded company has launched its own blockchain, and Coinbase hopes to earn revenue from transaction fees and dapps in future.

The Horizen blockchain [announced](https://www.bitcoininsider.org/article/218557/zen-will-no-longer-be-privacy-coin-after-horizen-update) the intention to remove the on chain "shielded pools" privacy feature of ZEN at the consensus level via hard fork. The reasoning for the decision is to avoid regulatory backlash against "privacy coins" by no longer qualifying for that category. Horizen's privacy pools were based on Zcash's "Sprout" technology, which Zcash has long since replaced, and so this is being taken as an opportunity to replace outdated tech with something based on sidechains or another method that will allow ZEN to get back to being listed on exchanges. The change is included in a new Horizen update which should activate in September for the mainchain.

An early success/hype story for Base came in the form of [friend.tech](https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2023/08/11/is-friendtech-a-friend-or-foe-a-dive-into-the-new-social-app-driving-millions-in-trading-volume/), a social app where users can buy "shares" (soon [renamed](https://decrypt.co/153287/friend-tech-shares-renamed-keys-securities) to "keys") in other users, and owning such keys allows one to send messages to them. When the hype kicked in friend.tech quickly hit 126K transactions and 4,400 ETH volume, more than the entire NFT ecosystem for that period. friend.tech is a rebranding of "stealcam", and from someone best known for "Tweet DAO eggs", NFTs that allowed holders to tweet from a certain account, until the account was suspended and the website taken down. By the end of the month activity was already [substantially down](https://cointelegraph.com/news/friendtech-pronounced-dead-inflows-activity-declines) on all metrics, with transactions and fee revenue dropping by 80% from the initial peak.

In a bid to capitalise on the hype around friends.tech, a new meme token was launched on Ethereum - FrensTech. It was rugged by its founder when the price started to explode, AzFlin [withdrew](https://www.theblock.co/post/244591/uniswap-frenstech) all his tokens from the liquidity pool and cashed them in, cratering the price. After a twitter sleuth [exposed](https://twitter.com/UniswapVillain/status/1690216623041372161) the identity of the rug-puller as a Uniswap employee, he got [fired](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1690395983773880321).

Gitcoin [announced](https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-shell-collaboration) a controversial partner for the latest round of quadratic matched funding, the Shell (oil) company sponsoring a climate solutions matching pool. There was a significant [backlash](https://decrypt.co/152662/greenwashing-gitcoin-shell-partnership-draws-fire-crypto-pundits) from Gitcoin supporters on twitter, who were disappointed to see the brand tarnished (in their view) by the association with Shell, who were exploiting the public relationship with Gitcoin as cost effective greenwashing. The backlash led someone who was involved in the decision making to post an apologetic [tweet](https://twitter.com/kbw/status/1691797028987162874) explaining how the decision had been arrived at and acknowledging the problems with such a relationship. One of the main criticisms, [from](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1691488210315288576) founder Owocki, was that not only was the brand being sold for greenwashing, the amount Shell were paying in as grant funding was just $500K, so they were getting a very good deal for such a large and well resourced corporation. Gitcoin approved this partnership because the relevant council members had faith in the quadratic matching concept to steer the funds to worthy recipients regardless of where the money was coming from, in a sense that they were above the suspicion that would commonly surround outcomes from a "climate solutions" call sponsored by one of the big oil companies.

The SEC [lost](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/29/sec-must-review-grayscales-etf-bid-appeals-court-rules/) a court decision about the Grayscale ETF currently under review, with the court throwing agreeing with Grayscale's case that it was being treated unfairly because two substantially similar futures funds had been approved. This decision sparked a rally in the BTC market as the prospect of an approved ETF was seen as more likely, but by the time the SEC [announced](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/31/after-grayscale-victory-sec-kicks-the-can-on-latest-bitcoin-etf-applications/) it was delaying decisions on all Bitcoin ETFs the retrace was complete.

Republicans on the SEC oversight committee in US Congress have [demanded](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/15/republican-lawmakers-demand-gensler-tell-them-how-prometheum-got-sec-approval/) that Gary Gensler explain what is going on with Prometheum getting approval as a special crypto broker suddenly when all of the more well known crypto exchanges that actually have working products have found this to be a long and painful process that goes nowhere. 23 members of the committee signed a [letter](https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2023-08-09_fsc_gop_letter_to_sec_re_prometheum.pdf) outlining their suspicion, which is that Prometheum's sudden appearance in Washington and unheralded approval of their license to operate came at a very convenient time for Gensler - because the total lack of approved crypto broker dealers to that point was weakening his argument that the regulations are fine the way they are written (and he is enforcing them). The letter also references Prometheum's connections to Wanxiang and the CCP as cause for concern.

The SEC went after its first NFT project for securities [violations](https://protos.com/sec-says-nfts-are-securities-in-landmark-case/), the Impact Theory project had raised around $30 million from the sale of NFTs which was described as funding the company's operations. Impact Theory made the SEC's job easier by issuing statements saying they "will make sure that we do something that, by any reasonable standard, people got a crushing, hilarious amount of value." and describing the tokens as "the mechanism by which communities will be able to capture economic value from the growth of the company they support." The company agreed to buy back and destroy the tokens, eliminate the royalty sharing feature, and find a way to return the rest of the money they raised through the sale. There is speculation that this could be the first of many enforcement actions targeting NFTs, as "funding a roadmap" was a common purpose given for the minting events.

Binance's SEC woes have been added to by a [sealed](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/29/secs-secret-binance-court-filing-has-observers-bracing-for-bad-news/) court filing, where the contents of 35 exhibits are not being publicly disclosed for some unknown reason, possibly having to do with a concurrent criminal investigation by DoJ, but in any case highly unusual.

Coingecko has added a category of "tokens the SEC considers to be [securities](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/alleged-sec-securities)", which is a handy way to list all of the various altcoins that have or had enforcement actions against them by the SEC.

The US Treasury Department has [released](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1705) proposed rules which would introduce a new tax reporting obligation for crypto asset brokers, and would [define](https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1695061496177258731) these very broadly in a way which includes decentralized exchanges and operators of websites that communicate with wallets. A few form would be created (1099-DA) which brokers must complete and send to both the IRS and the individual users, calculating how much they likely owe in taxes. The rule is planned to be effective for brokers in 2025 for the 2026 tax filing season.

In the US the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) has [released](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-staking-rewards-taxable-gross-income-once-received-irs) a clarification on how staking rewards (from PoS blockchains) are to be taxed. The recipient of staking rewards should declare them as income at the point when they gain "dominion" over the tokens (can sell them), based on the fair market exchange value of the tokens at that time. 

The DEA has fallen victim to an address dusting attack and [sent](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2023/08/24/dea-accidentally-sends-50000-in-drug-proceeds-to-crypto-scammer) $50,000 of seized crypto to a scammer by mistake. DEA staff seized some USDT by transferring to their own Trezor hardware wallet, and in preparation to transfer this to the US Marshalls they sent a small test transaction, a scammer spotted this transaction and then set an airdrop to the DEA account so that it looked like the test transaction was successful, but swapping in their own very similar address. When the DEA staff came to make the real transfer they copied the (scammer's) address from a block explorer erroneously, possibly checked that the first and last few characters matched what they expected as the Marshalls' address, and hit send.

An early victim of a Bitcoin "clipboard hijack" hack through the Electrum Atom wallet in 2018, Andrew Schrober, began an investigation and has been pursuing the alleged attackers in the courts since 2021. The hacked software would monitor the user's clipboard and when it detected something like a Bitcoin address it would generate a replacement address which looked similar but actually was controlled by the attacker's wallet, and then the user would mistakenly send their BTC to the substituted address. Some of the filings in the case provide a detailed [account](https://medium.com/@nbax/anatomy-of-a-bitcoin-heist-the-electrum-atom-malware-saga-1685abf7c903) of how the BTC was moved and sent to Bitfinex, where they connected a used IP address to a residential UK address where one of their suspects lived. The account also details Monero transactions which are thought to be linked because of specific amounts going in/out with implausible decoy ring members, and the use of vanity addresses for Shapeshift transactions.

Lastpass has been [identified](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1696222671699329271) as the most likely compromise vector for the mysterious crypto thefts that have been [documented](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1648187031468781568) since April by community developer/sleuths but apparently ongoing since Dec 2022. The thefts are distinctive because they happen in certain time windows and have commonalities like exchanging tokens for ETH within the wallet before sending out, or sometimes sending tokens to another victim's address until the ETH amount is large enough that they transfer to their own address. These funds are moved to centralized swapping services where they are exchanged to BTC, victims are often losing other assets like LTC, XRP, XMR, and they all go to the same places to be changed to BTC which then gets mixed. @tayvano_ on twitter now seems convinced that the common detail reported by almost all victims is that they stored their private key on Lastpass, often for many years under the protection of a secure encryption password. Lastpass was [hacked](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1696222673632977054) in mid-2022 but the scope is unclear and the hackers should not have been able to access data that users had stored with strong encryption passwords, but that is seemingly what is occurring to result in these thefts from many "Crypto OGs".

Coindesk has [retracted](https://beincrypto.com/coindesk-poor-journalism-retracts-articles/) two articles, a rare occurrence [according](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/24/chainalysis-investigations-lead-is-unaware-of-scientific-evidence-the-surveillance-software-works/) to them. The [first](https://web.archive.org/web/20230728103222/https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/24/chainalysis-investigations-lead-is-unaware-of-scientific-evidence-the-surveillance-software-works/) concerned Chainalysis, reporting that the head of investigations was "unaware" of any scientific evidence for the accuracy of its Reactor software, while being questioned as part of a court hearing which seeks to use the outputs of this tool as evidence. The article was [retracted](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/24/chainalysis-investigations-lead-is-unaware-of-scientific-evidence-the-surveillance-software-works/) in July but the author was not informed and did not discover this until August, when they [complained](https://twitter.com/L0laL33tz/status/1696086324254494914) about Coindesk's ethics and suggested that the retraction was due to Coindesk's parent company DCG owning a stake in Chainalysis. The second [retracted](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/08/25/justin-sun-the-next-do-kwon-or-sbf/) article concerned Justin Sun, comparing him to SBF and Do Kwon and then [speculating](https://web.archive.org/web/20230826054525/https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/08/25/justin-sun-the-next-do-kwon-or-sbf/) about the scale of collateral damage if Sun's empire collapses. Coindesk used the same rationale to explain both retractions, that they should not have been published because they are written by pseudonymous authors and attack specific individuals in a defamatory way.

Tether has [announced](https://tether.to/en/tether-makes-strategic-transition-to-meet-community-demands-and-foster-innovation/) that it will stop supporting USDT on the Bitcoin Omni layer, the first transport layer used by Tether since 2014 - support will also be cut for Kusama and Bitcoin Cash networks. While USDT started on Omni much of the volume has migrated to smart contract chains, of $82 billion outstanding only $240 million are circulating on Omni, and considerably less on the other two networks to lose support. Redemptions will continue to be available for 12 months from Aug 17.
