## { Some Announcement }

{ _Add individual sections for high-impact announcements, such as consensus votes, software releases, milestones, major bugs, etc._ }


<a id="development" />

## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover its most notable dev work._
- _For each project, the order of reporting is "OLDEST FIRST", or "most released first": changes released to end users, merged to master, in progress (work started), discussions and future plans._
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

- _For each project:_
  - _Step 1: Add every commit in chronological order_
  - _Step 2: Organize:_
    - _released, master, progress, future_
    - _user-facing up top, dev stuff down below_
  - _Step 3: Group further and tidy_

In August the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 7,155 DCR worth $99K at August's average rate of $13.89. 5,961 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $83K at same rate.

A [treasury spend tx](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/144c17b0542e4aecb6c2b00b905552b001055dcf8298a0cd8ce0c1409e4bb2e4) was approved with 7,163 Yes votes and 56% turnout, and mined on Aug 28. It had 26 outputs making payments to contractors, ranging from 7 DCR to 2,036 DCR. Most of this DCR was likely paid for June work, at its billing exchange rate of $14.25 the TSpend is worth around $85K.

{ _Other interesting facts/stories about the legacy or new treasury._ }

As of Aug 2, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 865,779 DCR (11.1 million USD at $12.81).

{ _High-level recap of decision-making activity and most important events._ }

There were 3 new proposals subitted:

Coinbase's new Ethereum layer 2 network using the Optimism stack [launched](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/09/coinbase-officially-launches-base-blockchain-milestone-for-a-public-company/), it is called Base. This is the first time a publicly traded company has launched its own blockchain, and Coinbase hopes to earn revenue from transaction fees and dapps in future.

An early success/hype story for Base came in the form of [friend.tech](https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2023/08/11/is-friendtech-a-friend-or-foe-a-dive-into-the-new-social-app-driving-millions-in-trading-volume/), a social app where users can buy "shares" (soon [renamed](https://decrypt.co/153287/friend-tech-shares-renamed-keys-securities) to "keys") in other users, and owning such keys allows one to send messages to them. When the hype kicked in friend.tech quickly hit 126K transactions and 4,400 ETH volume, more than the entire NFT ecosystem for that period. friend.tech is a rebranding of "stealcam", and from someone best known for "Tweet DAO eggs", NFTs that allowed holders to tweet from a certain account, until the account was suspended and the website taken down. By the end of the month activity was already [substantially down](https://cointelegraph.com/news/friendtech-pronounced-dead-inflows-activity-declines) on all metrics, with transactions and fee revenue dropping by 80% from the initial peak.

In a bid to capitalise on the hype around friends.tech, a new meme token was launched on Ethereum - FrensTech. It was rugged by its founder when the price started to explode, AzFlin [withdrew](https://www.theblock.co/post/244591/uniswap-frenstech) all his tokens from the liquidity pool and cashed them in, cratering the price. After a twitter sleuth [exposed](https://twitter.com/UniswapVillain/status/1690216623041372161) the identity of the rug-puller as a Uniswap employee, he got [fired](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1690395983773880321).

Gitcoin [announced](https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-shell-collaboration) a controversial partner for the latest round of quadratic matched funding, the Shell (oil) company sponsoring a climate solutions matching pool. There was a significant [backlash](https://decrypt.co/152662/greenwashing-gitcoin-shell-partnership-draws-fire-crypto-pundits) from Gitcoin supporters on twitter, who were disappointed to see the brand tarnished (in their view) by the association with Shell, who were exploiting the public relationship with Gitcoin as cost effective greenwashing. The backlash led someone who was involved in the decision making to post an apologetic [tweet](https://twitter.com/kbw/status/1691797028987162874) explaining how the decision had been arrived at and acknowledging the problems with such a relationship. One of the main criticisms, [from](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1691488210315288576) founder Owocki, was that not only was the brand being sold for greenwashing, the amount Shell were paying in as grant funding was just $500K, so they were getting a very good deal for such a large and well resourced corporation. Gitcoin approved this partnership because the relevant council members had faith in the quadratic matching concept to steer the funds to worthy recipients regardless of where the money was coming from, in a sense that they were above the suspicion that would commonly surround outcomes from a "climate solutions" call sponsored by one of the big oil companies.

The SEC [lost](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/29/sec-must-review-grayscales-etf-bid-appeals-court-rules/) a court decision about the Grayscale ETF currently under review, with the court throwing agreeing with Grayscale's case that it was being treated unfairly because two substantially similar futures funds had been approved. This decision sparked a rally in the BTC market as the prospect of an approved ETF was seen as more likely, but by the time the SEC [announced](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/31/after-grayscale-victory-sec-kicks-the-can-on-latest-bitcoin-etf-applications/) it was delaying decisions on all Bitcoin ETFs the retrace was complete.

Republicans on the SEC oversight committee in US Congress have [demanded](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/15/republican-lawmakers-demand-gensler-tell-them-how-prometheum-got-sec-approval/) that Gary Gensler explain what is going on with Prometheum getting approval as a special crypto broker suddenly when all of the more well known crypto exchanges that actually have working products have found this to be a long and painful process that goes nowhere. 23 members of the committee signed a [letter](https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2023-08-09_fsc_gop_letter_to_sec_re_prometheum.pdf) outlining their suspicion, which is that Prometheum's sudden appearance in Washington and unheralded approval of their license to operate came at a very convenient time for Gensler - because the total lack of approved crypto broker dealers to that point was weakening his argument that the regulations are fine the way they are written (and he is enforcing them). The letter also references Prometheum's connections to Wanxiang and the CCP as cause for concern.

The US Treasury Department has [released](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1705) proposed rules which would introduce a new tax reporting obligation for crypto asset brokers, and would [define](https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1695061496177258731) these very broadly in a way which includes decentralized exchanges and operators of websites that communicate with wallets. A few form would be created (1099-DA) which brokers must complete and send to both the IRS and the individual users, calculating how much they likely owe in taxes. The rule is planned to be effective for brokers in 2025 for the 2026 tax filing season.

The DEA has fallen victim to an address dusting attack and [sent](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2023/08/24/dea-accidentally-sends-50000-in-drug-proceeds-to-crypto-scammer) $50,000 of seized crypto to a scammer by mistake. DEA staff seized some USDT by transferring to their own Trezor hardware wallet, and in preparation to transfer this to the US Marshalls they sent a small test transaction, a scammer spotted this transaction and then set an airdrop to the DEA account so that it looked like the test transaction was successful, but swapping in their own very similar address. When the DEA staff came to make the real transfer they copied the (scammer's) address from a block explorer erroneously, possibly checked that the first and last few characters matched what they expected as the Marshalls address, and hit send.

Lastpass has been [identified](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1696222671699329271) as the most likely compromise vector for the mysterious crypto thefts that have been [documented](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1648187031468781568) since April by community developer/sleuths but apparently ongoing since Dec 2022. The thefts are distinctive because they happen in certain time windows and have commonalities like exchanging tokens for ETH within the wallet before sending out, or sometimes sending tokens to another victim's address until the ETH amount is large enough that they transfer to their own address. These funds are moved to centralized swapping services where they are exchanged to BTC, victims are often losing other assets like LTC, XRP, XMR, and they all go to the same places to be changed to BTC which then gets mixed. @tayvano_ on twitter now seems convinced that the common detail reported by almost all victims is that they stored their private key on Lastpass, often for many years under the protection of a secure encryption password. Lastpass was [hacked](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1696222673632977054) in mid-2022 but the scope is unclear and the hackers should not have been able to access data that users had stored with strong encryption passwords, but that is seemingly what is occurring to result in these thefts from many "Crypto OGs".

Coindesk has [retracted](https://beincrypto.com/coindesk-poor-journalism-retracts-articles/) two articles, a rare occurrence [according](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/24/chainalysis-investigations-lead-is-unaware-of-scientific-evidence-the-surveillance-software-works/) to them. The [first](https://web.archive.org/web/20230728103222/https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/24/chainalysis-investigations-lead-is-unaware-of-scientific-evidence-the-surveillance-software-works/) concerned Chainalysis, reporting that the head of investigations was "unaware" of any scientific evidence for the accuracy of its Reactor software, while being questioned as part of a court hearing which seeks to use the outputs of this tool as evidence. The article was [retracted](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/24/chainalysis-investigations-lead-is-unaware-of-scientific-evidence-the-surveillance-software-works/) in July but the author was not informed and did not discover this until August, when they [complained](https://twitter.com/L0laL33tz/status/1696086324254494914) about Coindesk's ethics and suggested that the retraction was due to Coindesk's parent company DCG owning a stake in Chainalysis. The second [retracted](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/08/25/justin-sun-the-next-do-kwon-or-sbf/) article concerned Justin Sun, comparing him to SBF and Do Kwon and then [speculating](https://web.archive.org/web/20230826054525/https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/08/25/justin-sun-the-next-do-kwon-or-sbf/) about the scale of collateral damage if Sun's empire collapses. Coindesk used the same rationale to explain both retractions, that they should not have been published because they are written by pseudonymous authors and attack specific individuals in a defamatory way.

_2. Order the stories as follows:_

- _Crypto L1 tech: PoW, ASIC resistance, full nodes, network security, etc._
- _Crypto L2+ tech: "Smart" contracts, DEX projects_
- _Crypto governance, finances, transparency, funding, chain forks, community splits_
