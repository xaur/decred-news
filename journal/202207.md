## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

- Fixed [broadcasting of winning tickets](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2968) when there are multiple next block candidates ("chain tips") and some of them do not yet have their block data available. Voting wallets connected to dcrd in such state were unable to re-start voting for blocks due to an error.
- Removed [planetdecred.org seeders](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2974) for both mainnet and testnet as requested by their maintainer.
- Private key generation [implemented directly](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2971) for the secp256k1 curve to replace the generic version in the standard library with any adaptor code it required. Not only is this implementation significantly more efficient, both in terms of execution speed and memory allocations, it also is theoretically more secure since it does not have the modulo bias the implementation in the standard lib does.
- Significantly [optimized CPU mining](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2977) code that is useful for mining on testnet. Speed stat tracking code reworked to improve accuracy and performance. Before this change the hashrate was ~0.5 Mh/s and up to 2 cores could be used efficiently. Optimized code hashes at 1.2 Mh/s on a single core and over 10 Mh/s with 10 cores.
- Reformatted [doc comments](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2976) in the entire repository with `gofmt` in the new Go 1.19. Doing it all at once in a single commit saves future commits from extra diff clutter.
- Other improvements { 2969 2970 2972; drop after review }

### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

JSON-RPC:

- Fixed `signrawtransasction` command not seeing the provided [private keys](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2173) for signing P2PKH inputs.

Ticketbuyer:

- Do not attempt to [mix change](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2171) if CoinShuffle++ server is unset. 

In progress:

- Add requests to allow Decrediton to get and update the [pending TSpend voting policies](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2172).


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

In progress - [voting on individual TSpend transactions](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3787) is being introduced into Decredition:

- The Treasury Spending tab will display pending TSpends and the ability to vote.
- On the Home view users will see notifications of new active and not yet voted TSpends.
- Ticket details page will show treasury key and TSpend vote choices that have been set on the VSP.

{ image candidates: 3787 }


### Politeia

_[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia) is Decred's proposal system. It is used to request funding from the Decred treasury._

Backend - tstore:

- Removed ability to [use LevelDB](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1651) as a key-value storage for tstore, which is now MySQL by default. Since MySQL is required by Trillian anyway, removing an alternative storage backend simplifies politeiad setup and makes the code easier to maintain.
- Updated the tstore backend to allow [overwriting](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1652) existing entries. tstore saves data in 2 steps: save data in the key-value store, and then append its hash onto the Trillian tree. Overwriting existing entries fixes the inability to resubmit unchanged data if the second step failed.

Backend - legacy proposals:

- Added an [`import` command](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1632) to the legacypoliteia tool. It imports the JSON data into the tstore backend that was generated during the execution of the `convert` command. The two commands (`convert` and `import`) allow to migrate most data from the previous version of Politeia into the current version. Client and server signatures are not imported since they don't match the converted data. Some Trillian weirdness had to be investigated and addressed with extensive testing and workarounds.

Backend - `ticketvote` plugin:

- Implemented the ticketvote plugin's [fsck function](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1659) that rebuilds all of its caches.
- Rewrote the runoff vote [submissions cache](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1658) and moved it from the file system to the tstore provided plugin cache.
- Moved the [vote summaries cache](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1657) from the file system to the tstore provided plugin cache.
- Rewrote ticketvote [inventory cache](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1649) with an improved API, better documentation, and saving data in the tstore database instead of the file system. { _maybe group with similar changes moving fs to tstore cache_ }
- Added the [timestamp](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1653) of the last vote status change to the vote summary structure. This allows to pull less data when rebuilding the vote inventory.

Backend - other changes:

- Fixed bug where [empty comments](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1655) were accepted.
- Removed [legacy websockets code](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1660) which was never used for anything.
- Code cleanup and packaging. { 1656, 1662, 1661, 1666; drop after review}
- Various improvements, tweaking etc.

politeaivoter command-line app:

- Consolidated [config error handling](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1648) to cover more cases consistently.

Politeia GUI:

- Removed hardcoded [legacy proposals](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2762) and code handling them, now that they have been migrated into the current Politeia database.
- Various tweaks and improvements. { 2805 2813 2832x3 ; drop after review }
- Fixes { 2819 2817 2822 2811 2832x4; some may be unreleased bugs while the plugin arch was shaping up; drop after review }

Politeia GUI progress towards the new [plugin architecture](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/tree/master/plugins-structure#politeiagui---plugins-structure):

- Added a `politeiagui-scripts` [CLI package](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2827). It deduplicates common configuration and provides 7 commands for developing and testing plugins and apps.
- Each plugin can now [export "effects"](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2800) that developers can reuse and compose in their Politeia-like apps. For example, when the user scrolls to the end of the list, code to fetch next batch of proposals/comments/vote summaries can be called from the plugins responsible for these pluggable features.
- Show a warning modal for [external links](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2804).


### cspp

_[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp) is a server for coordinating coin mixes using the CoinShuffle++ protocol. It is non-custodial, i.e. does not hold any funds._

- [@jy-p says he's made a lot of progress](https://youtu.be/1RBBNnrPqc0?t=123) with @jrick on peer-to-peer mixing for Decred's StakeShuffle privacy service. Currently StakeShuffle relies on a central server at [mix.decred.org](https://mix.decred.org/).


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

{ _Group by topic_ }

- Optimized [high resource use](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1684) when typing price.
- Fixed creating native BTC wallet with [too small fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1657).
- Added a short delay for [sending ZEC](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/6045) after a block is mined in load tests, to workaround an issue with Zcash [output selection](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/6045).
- Clarified the message about [disabling a DEX server](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1634). With the recent account discovery features, a server can be disabled and reenabled as needed without paying the registration fee again.
- Fixed native BTC SPV wallet getting wrecked after [sending too small](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1705) ("dust") amount, which should not be allowed.
- Enforced [code formatting](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1699) check during CI builds for consistency.
- Increase ETH [gas fee cap](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1692) for redemptions when base fee is too high.
- Added ability to [export ETH wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1648) to Metamask.
- Fixed block monitoring for DCR SPV wallets and improved [connectivity error messages](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1701).
- Fixed [Filled percentage](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1711) display for market buys.
- Added general support for [live wallet reconfiguration](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1686) and implemented it for BTC. This allows locked coins to be re-established after wallet configuration was changed. Prior to this change, reconfiguring a wallet with live orders was unlocking the funds but attempting to use them resulted in an error.
- Fixed users getting [order completion credit](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1707) for revoked orders in rare circumstances.
- Support [external source](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1654) of transaction fee estimates for DCR wallets (dcrdata's Insight API), to serve as a fallback when the wallet cannot get the fee estimate locally.
- Display [fiat equivalents](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1600) in various places of the UI.
- Added support for common [Electrum SPV](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1607) wallets (BTC, LTC, BCH). DEX client can communicate with a local Electrum wallet (min version 4.2) and use its funds for trading.
- Implemented [fee rate caching and expiry](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1721) to resolve a long-standing issue of using outdated fee rate. Also optimized how frequent fee rate is fetched from various sources (wallet, order book, external API).
- Changed how [ETH wallet's private key](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1702) is derived to have an extra step where Ethereum BIP-39 mnemonic is generated, and then the private key is derived from that seed. This leaves the door open to exporting both the seed words and the account private key in the future.
- Minimum required [Bitcoin Core version](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1735) bumped to v0.21 (and v22 for using descriptor wallets).
- Added a test for [arithmetic overflow](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1722) in the Ethereum's Solidity contract. Starting with Solidity v0.8.0 the transaction _should_ be reverted automatically if there is an overflow. The test is added just in case Solidity version used in DCRDEX is somehow reduced below v0.8.0, or if future Solidity versions remove this protection. However unlikely that may be, it's better to be safe than sorry.

- Testing improvements { 1691 1743 1745 }
- Other improvements { 1694 1709 1723 } and fixes { 1704 1713 1729 1746 1740 }

### GoDCR

_[GoDCR](https://github.com/planetdecred/godcr) is a lightweight desktop GUI wallet with integrated staking, privacy, Politeia voting, consensus voting, and more._

- Implemented a new [Staking tab design](https://github.com/planetdecred/godcr/pull/1016).
- Fixed [handling](https://github.com/planetdecred/godcr/pull/1023) of wallet deletion. 
- Added DEX [server selector](https://github.com/planetdecred/godcr/pull/1011), ability to use custom server, and payment of the registration fee.
- Updated Wallet Settings page to the [latest UI](https://github.com/planetdecred/godcr/pull/1007).
- Implemented a new [Overview page](https://github.com/planetdecred/godcr/pull/1008) design.
- Updated [Transactions page](https://github.com/planetdecred/godcr/pull/893) (improved tx row display, count of each tx type in the filter dropdown, etc.).
- Numerous bug fixes and UI tweaks. { ~893x3 ~1008x2 ~1007x2 1011x1 976x4 ; hard to count properly }
- Translation updates.

In progress:

- New [Transaction page](https://github.com/planetdecred/godcr/issues/1025) design.
- Streamlined API in dcrlibwallet for [pulling data](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrlibwallet/pull/255) from the dcrdata block explorer and exchanges.
- New [StakeShuffle page](https://github.com/planetdecred/godcr/pull/1024) layout.
- [Proposal search](https://github.com/planetdecred/godcr/pull/1027) functionality.

### dcrdata

_[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata) is an explorer for Decred blockchain and off-chain data like Politeia proposals, markets, and more._

- Added [message signature verification](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1911) page and two new HTTP API endpoints for use in scripts and apps. [Request body limiter](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/commit/c9d07773f51cc93186d6c4d1c1f74f8c170f297d) was also added with a default of 2 MiB, down from default 10 MiB.

In progress:

- Expose more [treasury mechanics](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1918) like quorum progress, approx. vote start/end date, Pi keys used, and more.
- Devs are looking into [pagination problems](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/1925) on the Treasury page.

{ image candidates: 1911 }


### Documentation

_[dcrdocs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs) is the source code for Decred [user documentation](https://docs.decred.org/)._

- Updated docs related to [command-line apps](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1193) to match v1.7.2 release, and mentioned support of Apple M1 chip and BSD systems.
- [Updated and reorganized](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1195) the [Using the Block Explorer](https://docs.decred.org/getting-started/using-the-block-explorer/) guide to address some [confusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/uqrdpa/dcr_data_looking_into_a_block_decred_fundamentals/i8su4lb/) on Reddit.


### decred.org

_[dcrweb](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb) is the source code for the decred.org website._

- [Social media](https://decred.org/community/) links were [cleaned up](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1052). Notably, Chinese specific social media has been removed due to a lack of control and proper moderation over these channels.

## Governance

In July the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 9,204 DCR worth $220K at month's average rate of $23.93. 3,205 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $77K at July's rate, or $90K at June's billing rate of $28.06.

The treasury spend [tx](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/tx/453e713358bb3c5662ebc1f58c50c50ceb66a950dae925701d8e25a3c4c72d4e) was mined on July 24, it had 20 outputs ranging from 2.8 DCR to 1,184 DCR. The transaction was approved with 4,590 Yes votes and 7 No votes.

As of Aug 8, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 807,000 DCR (30.7 million USD at $38.01).

There were no new proposals in July. The Decred Magazine [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3bb2c7e) was approved in July with approval of 87% and turnout of 28%.


## Network

**Hashrate**: July's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=l4vb70eb-l6cmn0q7&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~87 Ph/s and closed ~44 Ph/s, bottoming at 28 Ph/s and peaking at 116 Ph/s throughout the month.

## Ecosystem

{ _Hint: "Ecosystem" is about new units of infrastructure or updates from existing: VSPs, exchanges, wallets, OTC desks, payment processors, investors. It is more about user-facing services, businesses, and wider adoption, while Network is more about the backbone. Use bullets or paragraphs, whatever looks best._ }

Two new VSPs were listed on decred.org and in Decrediton: [vspd.bass.cf](https://vspd.bass.cf/) by {} and [dcrhive.com](https://dcrhive.com/) by @kozel. { Recap of plans in https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/vt0wrt/dcr_hive_a_new_lowish_fee_vsp_coming_to_your/ }

Binance has reduced required [DCR confirmations](https://matrix.to/#/!lDZCzVQjFoJsXMPkvr:decred.org/$XSPP3KlRoIcNt3cqBG9ZbgTnwu88Kr6VcwPDTNEGZo4?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=planetdecred.org) from 20 to 6 according to @jz.

[BisonPool](https://bisonpool.org/) has officially launched. BisonPool is a new kind of proof-of-stake pool which enables all Decred holders to earn PoS rewards, even if they cannot afford a whole ticket on their own. To make this possible, BisonPool pools user's DCR to purchase tickets. The ticket rewards are split among participants based on the amount of DCR they were able to provide. See the [announcement on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/vyydm1/bisonpool_is_now_live/).

Users have no control over voting preferences for their tickets on BisonPool.

It should be noted that this is a custodial service, meaning Bisonpool has control of user's funds. There is a risk that your Decred can be stolen if you choose to use this service. Remember, not your keys, not your coins. 

Warning: the authors of the Decred Journal have no idea about the trustworthiness of any of the services above. Please do your own research before trusting your personal information or assets to any entity.
