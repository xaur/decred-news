## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

<a id="dcrd"></a>

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

_dcrd is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Explicit Version Upgrades consensus change ([DCP-8](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0008/dcp-0008.mediawiki)):

- new consensus rules have been [implemented](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2716). Once activated, unknown transaction and script versions will be rejected until they have explicitly been enabled by another consensus change. Coins that were spendable before activation will remain spendable. This change will provide greater network security and allow developers to write more bug-proof code, as explained in [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3a98861) comments, [DCP-8](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0008/dcp-0008.mediawiki), and a recent dev [discussion](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2719#issuecomment-909535320).
- @davecgh posted a [proposal update](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3a98861/comments/21) that all dcrd development work is complete

Automatic Ticket Revocations consensus change ([DCP-9](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0009/dcp-0009.mediawiki)):

- [preparations](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2718): added tests, added agenda definitions, reorganized code to fit upcoming changes. A new transaction priority was introduced to ensure automatic revocations are always created. Full list of priorities becomes: votes (highest) > automatic revocations > tickets > regular transactions and revocations (lowest).
- [implemented](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2720) the actual consensus change. Once activated, blocks will be required to contain revocations for all tickets that become missed or expired as of that block. New rules will also allow unlocking some [~200K DCR](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/proposals/e2d7b7d/docs/unrevoked-missed-tickets.md) that got stuck in unrevoked missed tickets.
- @rstaudt2 posted a [proposal update](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d/comments/19) that all dcrd development work is complete

Other merged work:

- implemented spend journal [pruning](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2641) that delays removal of spend journal entries until they are no longer used (this is needed for [asynchronous indexing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1470) that will speed up block validation)
- added more tests for address manager and [decoupled](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2596) it from `wire` package, in preparation for upcoming changes in the wire protocol
- pinned [Docker](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2735) images and GitHub [Actions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2736) with hashes instead of tags for better supply chain security
- reworked [Docker](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2740) support to provide an image with a strong focus on security. It only includes Decred-specific binaries ("distroless") and runs them as an unprivileged user. The new final image is around 10 MB, compared to ~1 GB for the previous version.
- code upgraded to use [Go 1.16](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2722) features
- updated module [hierarchy](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2744) graph

> Huge dcrd release brewing... including 3 consensus votes, ~30% faster syncing, and much more. ([@rstaudt2](https://twitter.com/rstaudt2/status/1443668800679858181))

## Governance

In September the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 10,274 DCR worth $1.4M at September's average rate of $139.56. 590 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $82K at September's rate, or $95K at August's billing rate of $161.24. As of Oct 2, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 723,528 DCR (83.5 million USD at $115.45).

Two new proposals were submitted, both by @raedah, requesting renewed funding for [GoDCR](https://proposals.decred.org/record/f7d9fc8) and [Mobile Wallets](https://proposals.decred.org/record/6db3c4e).

Voter participation reached new heights, with both of the votes this month seeing turnout above the previous record level.

- The PR [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/58d9f46) from Monde was approved with 97.5% approval and a turnout of 75%.
- The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/150cf81) to fund an educational video series for the Indian market, from @finstreet21, was rejected with 45% approval and turnout of 77%.

The long-awaited proposal [author updates](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/1473) feature is now live on Politeia and has already been used by two [development](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3a98861) [proposals](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d) to report progress.

See Politeia Digest [issue 46](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue046/) and [issue 47](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue047/) for more details on the month's proposals.


## Network

**Hashrate**: September's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=kszlo86g-ku72gu79&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~355 Ph/s and closed ~228 Ph/s, bottoming at 190 Ph/s and peaking at 449 Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on Oct 1: Poolin 36%, F2Pool 25%, AntPool 22%, BTC.com 5%, ViaBTC 5%, Luxor 3%, HuobiPool 1%, CoinMine 0.15%, OKEx 0.13%. Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) before Oct 1 confirmed the reported hashrate.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=kszlo86g-ku72gu79&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between 192.8-210.8 DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at 199.4 DCR (+5.6).

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=kszlo86g-ku72gu79&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was 7.69-8.16 million DCR, meaning that 57.7-61.1% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=kszlo86g-ku72gu79&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.

Ticket prices seem to have hit a relative plateau between two extremes.

**VSP**: On Oct 1, ~7,600 (-500) live tickets were managed by [listed](https://decred.org/vsp/) vspd servers and ~220 (-30) by listed legacy dcrstakepool servers. Collectively the 8 legacy and 15 new VSPs managed 19% (-2%) of the ticket pool. Unlisted but still active legacy VSPs managed 29 (-11) live tickets.

## Ecosystem

Matrix users are advised to upgrade their clients (most notably Element) to patch security [vulnerability](https://matrix.org/blog/2021/09/13/vulnerability-disclosure-key-sharing/) disclosed on Sep 13. If a user's account is compromised (by either a direct compromise of account credentials or by a compromised homeserver), in certain circumstances it may be possible to read encrypted messages sent to such account from its vulnerable contacts. The disclosure noted, "The greatest risk is to users who are in encrypted rooms containing malicious servers. Admins of malicious servers could attempt to impersonate their users' devices in order to spy on messages sent by vulnerable clients in that room.". As an extra safety measure, you can review active sessions and remove any obsolete or suspicious ones.

Legacy [decredvoting.com](https://decredvoting.com/) has been removed from the [VSP list](https://decred.org/vsp/) to facilitate user migration to the new [vspd system](https://blog.decred.org/2020/06/02/A-More-Private-Way-to-Stake/). Voting wallets are still online to vote the remaining tickets (9 tickets as of Oct 1). Decred Voting has served [since 2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9c6s3l/new_voting_service_provider_aka_stake_pool_is_now/) and is known for developing advanced features like email [notifications](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9oepq6/decredvotingcom_now_supporting_automatic_email/) on voted tickets and custom ticket analytics [dashboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hbofz4/tired_of_keeping_track_of_your_staking_activities/), and for supporting small holders with [education](https://medium.com/decred/dcr-ticket-splitting-all-you-need-to-know-b8edc6b65db3) on ticket splitting and [features](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/euqd4h/introducing_split_ticket_dashboard_on/) to make it easier to use.

For anyone still using legacy VSP, it is recommended to switch to [vspd providers](https://decred.org/vsp/) to avoid the risk of missed tickets, e.g. in case the legacy VSP shuts down or stops working with the coming consensus upgrades. As of Oct 1, all legacy VSPs managed less than 250 tickets or 0.6% of the ticket pool.

Sushi's Miso app was [exploited](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/17/3m-in-ether-stolen-from-sushiswaps-miso-launchpad/) to steal the proceeds of an NFT drop ($3M for Kia Sedonas from Jay Pegs Auto Mart). The attacker was [identified](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/17/3m-was-stolen-but-the-real-steal-is-these-kia-sedonas-say-anonymous-developers/) (through their use of ENS domain) as a Sushi developer, who had inserted code into the front end which would send funds to their own address. The funds were subsequently returned.

The Compound DeFi app deployed new smart contracts which [gave](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/30/defi-money-market-compound-overpays-15m-in-comp-rewards-in-possible-exploit/) away $80M worth of COMP tokens in unintended ways. Founder Robert Leshner asked recipients to send the tokens back, and described it as a moral [dilemma](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/01/compound-founder-says-80m-bug-presents-moral-dilemma-for-defi-users/), after initially intimating that people who don't give the tokens back could have their details passed to tax collection authorities. One interesting aspect of the story is that the problem was identified quite quickly, but because changing the contracts requires a governance process there was no way to deploy a quick fix and all of the vulnerable funds were drained.

Coinbase users have been [exploited](https://www.zdnet.com/article/coinbase-sends-out-breach-notification-letters-after-6000-accounts-had-funds-stolen/), it seems that around 6,000 users whose login details had been compromised elsewhere then suffered losses from their Coinbase accounts after the attackers exploited a flaw in Coinbase's SMS two-factor recovery process to bypass this safeguard and withdraw their victims' funds. In a notification [letter](https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/09-24-2021%20Customer%20Notification.pdf) to customers, Coinbase said the flaw has been fixed and that all affected customers will be reimbursed. This follows on from more general [discontent](https://www.zdnet.com/article/coinbase-sends-out-breach-notification-letters-after-6000-accounts-had-funds-stolen/) with Coinbase customer service in the summer.

The Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act, which was [introduced](https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5307) in July, continues to see [coverage](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-us-digital-assets-bill-casts-wide-5957884/) and discussion, indicating that it will receive serious consideration from lawmakers. The proposed Act is one of the broadest pieces of legislation to address digital assets and would clarify how different types of assets would fall under the purview of different enforcement agencies. The proposed definition of a security would focus on equity or voting rights in the issuing (corporate) entity, excluding voting on blockchain matters like block creation. There is also an aspect whereby selling tokens for an unfinished product whose production will be funded by the token sale (i.e. the ICO model) would be considered securities. Stablecoins could not be created or used without being approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve would receive the authority to issue a US central bank digital currency.
