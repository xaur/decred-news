# {DRAFT} Decred Journal – October 2018

![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover text}")

The big news of the month is the Politeia mainnet launch on October 16th, when decision-making power over the future direction of the project and Treasury funds were handed over to the stakeholder community. Congratulations to everyone and thanks to the Politeia team for the countless hours of work.

In a [blog post](https://blog.decred.org/2018/10/15/Politeia-in-Production/) to mark the occasion, @jy-p shared some insights from his experiences as a custodian of the [Decred Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx). He expressed optimism and interest in seeing what the Decred community would do with this power, but also cautioned about some pitfalls to be avoided and ways in which this grand governance experiment could go wrong.

New software version 1.3.1 was released to allow everyone to participate in Politeia. It adds Governance page to Decredition for GUI users, and introduces a new `politeiavoter` tool for CLI users. Get the downloads on [GitHub](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.1) and don't forget to [verify signatures](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/blob/v1.3.1/README.md#verifying-binaries).

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

* Another big step towards multipeer downloads entered testing. It [optimizes](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1500) chain reorganization logic for the typical case and makes reorganizations use less memory.
* Regression network (regnet) was [resurrected](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1480) and several unit tests were [migrated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1481) to it. This allowed to separate concerns and [optimize](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1482) simnet setup.
* [This change](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1476) simplifies setting up dcrd on a separate machine.
* New [getblockchaininfo](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1479) RPC provides useful chain-related information that was previously unavailable.
* Go Report Card was added to README and as of writing it is [showing](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/decred/dcrd) A+ rating for the project.
* Various RPC, testing and infrastructure improvements.

A lot of mining-related improvements are [in the pipeline](https://matrix.to/#/!NNzHoaSdnsbZDQOXJr:decred.org/$154003890434385mrGTu:decred.org).

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): bug fixes.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): [Version 1.3.1](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.1) reveals SPV and Politeia functionality to all users. It also adds first batch of translations that include French, Spanish, German, Japanese and Chinese (simplified). If you are a long standing community member and notice any incorrect translations you can open an issue on GitHub or contact the team on the slack/matrix chat platforms. To ensure high quality translations, some reputation with the project is currently required to submit translation issues. At the same time, the procedures to allow input from more users are being formalized.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): [ability](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/538) for admins to specify voting parameters (quorum, pass threshold and vote duration), [ability](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/537) to lock accounts that are abusing the system or for security reasons, [ability](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/655) to revoke proposal vote authorization. Multiple bug fixes and UI improvements. Many community members joined testing and submitted dozens of issue reports after launch.

Up next is adding notifications and other missing features. Longer term plan is to scale Politeia and develop smart contracts for the Treasury.

[Android](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): dcrandroid gained a PIN security option in addition to the existing password option for spending security. Another security feature is full wallet encryption and requiring the PIN/password to access the wallet. Android 9 support was added. The testnet version is now available to beta testers [on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.testnet), and they will automatically receive updates. A new testnet version is being pushed now. Several bugs and priority enhancements were done based on feedback from the last testing round. Testing for the mainnet release is being done.

[iOS](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): all crashing issues are resolved, and effort will be focused on getting it out to a larger testing audience and targeting a release after the Android release is out the door.

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): work to speed up initial sync ([751](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/751), [754](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/754), [752](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/752)), [disapproved blocks](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/733) page, Insight API [documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/719) by @s_ben, new visual blocks [home page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/718) by @itswisdomagain, time grouped [block listing](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/779). The newly merged features will be deployed in future releases.

Trezor: Decred support was [merged](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-core/pull/358) into Model T firmware repository. Decrediton integration can be merged after the next firmware release. This is all for normal transactions. Buying tickets will require more work and changes to dcrwallet.

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): v0.6.2 released, the downloads and release notes are [on GitHub](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/releases/tag/v0.6.2). On the master branch OpenBSD support was added among a few internal improvements.

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): updated relevant documentation for the 1.3.1 release, added new [Decrediton troubleshooting](https://docs.decred.org/getting-started/user-guides/decrediton-troubleshooting/) page, [upgrade](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/601) of mkdocs and material theme will simplify things.

Politeia documentation is nearing completion, SPV documentation is planned next.

[Design](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/releases): EETER updated Decred logo for better performance on digital screens. Check this [blog post](https://medium.com/decred/dcr-logo-performance-update-f12f94a7a33e) with details and comparison to old logo.

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb): [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/370) outdated compare page that caused some controversy, code cleanup, updated press and exchanges. 5 contractors added and 1 removed.

Did you know there are several [Decred packages](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&K=decred) in Arch User Repository?

There was a small [interruption](https://matrix.to/#/!VFRvyndKpzcLrVslQD:decred.org/$154021525435657VDmQn:decred.org) on GitHub that had a minor impact on work, but the developers are keeping an eye on GitHub.

Dev activity stats for October: 310 active PRs, 297 master commits, 65K added and 22K deleted lines spread across 8 repositories. Contributions came from 4-9 developers per repository. ([chart](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1060274048481906688))

## People

A warm welcome to the new contractor company: [Block 42](http://42block.io/). They have been contributing to development and design for some time, and now finally appeared [on decred.org](https://decred.org/contributors/).

Another warm welcome to new people contributing for the first time: [SergeyMikhlevskiy](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/commits?author=SergeyMikhlevskiy) (dcrandroid), [ademuanthony](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/commits?author=ademuanthony) and [buck54321](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/commits?author=buck54321) (dcrdata), [ggoranov](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commits?author=ggoranov) (dcrd), [gallexis](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commits?author=gallexis) (dcrwallet), [ZeroASIC](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/commits?author=ZeroASIC) (dcrweb), [szpasztor](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/commits?author=szpasztor) and [faelv](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/commits?author=faelv) (decrediton).

(_the list above may be incomplete, looking for help to automate the collection of info from repositories_)

## Governance

We had a total of 8 proposals on Politeia between Oct 1 and Nov 9 (_covering the beginning of Nov to avoid confusion with proposal statuses_).

1\. [Decred Open Source Research](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c68bb790ba0843980bb9695de4628995e75e0d1f36c992951db49eca7b3b4bcd) submitted by @richardred on Oct 16.

This proposal seeks funding for open source research and will be open to contributions from anyone with relevant skills who applies them productively to approved research projects. Discussion focused on the method of approving research projects and deciding which work is eligible for payment. $10,000 was requested as an initial budget for a few months.

Status: Approved. Voting finished on Nov 5 with 90.2% Yes votes.

2\. [Change language: PoS Mining to PoS Voting, Stakepool to Voting Service Provider](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/522652954ea7998f3fca95b9c4ca8907820eb785877dcf7fba92307131818c75) submitted by @richardred on Oct 19.

The proposal asks that changes be made to some common terminology related to Decred's Proof of Stake system.

Status: Approved. Voting finished on Nov 5 with 94.1% Yes votes.

3\. [Decred Contractor Clearance Process](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4) submitted by @jy-p on Oct 19.

The proposal describes a formal process for clearing new contractors to bill for their work on the project. It is motivated by the need to maintain high standards in the project's software development and other subdomains. Individual new contributors will have to be approved by 3 established contractors in the relevant subdomain before being cleared to bill for their work. DCCs can similarly be revoked with the agreement of 3 contractors within the domain. Disputes can be escalated to an all contractor vote, wherein each contractor would vote with a weight based on the amount of time they bill for on the project. The estimated project cost is $25,000, for work on a system for tracking contractors within domains and who has vouched for who.

Status: Author has not yet authorized the start of voting.

Two drafts of bug bounty proposals were posted for discussion: one [by u/rustyshacklefordton](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9sri0b/bug_bounty_politeia_funding_proposal/) and anoter [by @degeri](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9ubqmk/decred_bug_bounty_proposal/).

The monthly format of the Decred Journal is not well suited for timely updates about proposal activity on Politeia. To address this need, @richardred started a weekly [Politeia Digest](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/politeia-digest). It covers all proposals that were added or changed within a week, and provides some analysis. [First](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9qnye8/politeia_digest_issue_1_a_short_weekly_update_on/), [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9sruhn/politeia_digest_2_oct_2330th_2018/) and [third](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9v3ypu/politeia_digest_issue_3_oct_31nov_6_2018/) issues were posted on Reddit, Medium and GitHub.

## Network

Hashrate: nearly doubled in October, starting the month around 80 and ending around 156 PH/s. The low was 73 and the high was 193 PH/s. BeePool's share varied between 20-50%, F2Pool 25-35%, Luxor 3-5% and Coinmine 3-4%. Unknown hashrate held between 20-30% with several spikes to 60%. Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was 99.8 DCR (+1.8). The price varied between 96.5 and 102.6 DCR. Locked amount was 3.94-4.06 million DCR, which corresponded to 46.0-46.6% of the available supply.

Third most tickets purchased in a 24 hour period in 2018 was [noticed](https://twitter.com/ImacallyouJawdy/status/1047894895434842112) on Oct 3.

Nodes: as of Oct 31 there are 202 public listening nodes and 323 normal nodes per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats). Version distribution: 6% are v1.4.0(pre) dev builds (+1%), 45% on v1.3.0 (+15%), 28% on v1.2.0 (-14%), 14% on v1.1.2 (-1%), 5% on v1.1.0 (-1%).

## Mining

Obelisk posted two updates on their [mailing list](https://us16.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=393b2698d17bdfe48ac0422ac&id=87ef82fd96). Batch 1 has shipped, Batch 2-5 production is expected to begin shortly and will take about 6 weeks to build and ship, Obelisk pledged to mine no more than 2% of network hashrate (down from 20%), an article detailing [compensation policy](http://support.obelisk.tech/article/utx5ropgxt-compensation-policy) was posted, firmware update v1.2.0 was [released](https://obelisk.tech/downloads.html). DCR1 owners will be able to purchase SC1 upgrade boards and convert their units into Sia miners.

Meet StrongU, a new mining manufacturer who released two units:

* [STU-U1](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/strongu/stu-u1) has 11 TH/s at 1600 W, price around $1,400.
* [STU-U1+](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/strongu/stu-u1-1) has 12.8 TH/s at 1850 W, price around $1,600.

[@i2Rav](https://decred.slack.com/team/U9G4L5QTH) on behalf of i2 Trading offers Whatsminer D1 machines for purchase. Additionally they can host the units in their facility in China. DCR is accepted for both services. Reach out to him on Slack for details.

Iterative and their Chinese partner Mega Pool started a Megapool VSP and are soon to launch a PoW pool. They are hoping to provide a full suite of services for Decred stakeholders, from mining equipment and pools, all the way down to liquidation services of DCR into fiat or BTC.

## Integrations

Welcome _three_ new voting service providers, making a total of 20:

* [stakey.com](https://stakey.com) with 1% fee (do not confuse with [stakey.net](https://stakey.net/)).
* [dcrpos.megapool.info](https://dcrpos.megapool.info/) with 1% fee.
* [dcrstake.coinmine.pl](https://dcrstake.coinmine.pl/) with 0.5% fee.

[decredvoting.com](https://decredvoting.com) now supports automatic [email notification](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9oepq6/decredvotingcom_now_supporting_automatic_email/) for full and split tickets. Also it [added](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9qv235/voting_service_provider_decredvotingcom_is_now/) a 4th server in central Europe, in addition to 3 servers in the US.

[dcr.farm](https://dcr.farm/) recently [voted](https://matrix.to/#/!wSdymYrEpBhsWlDJuk:decred.org/$153991704133210OjYNP:decred.org) on its 10,000th ticket. To celebrate, they added a 6th voting wallet located in Japan.

Exchange integrations:

* [gate.io](https://www.gate.io/) [announced](https://twitter.com/gate_io/status/1049238635189391361) the addition of DCR trading against BTC and USDT.
* [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) [added](https://twitter.com/binance/status/1054572693725446144) DCR trading against BTC and BNB, [noting](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1054573983805423616) it as a "strong community project". Discussed on [r/binance](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/9qle8z/dcr_on_binance/) and [r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9qlac1/binance_just_announced_they_are_listing_decred_26/).
* [Easyrabbit](https://easyrabbit.net/) [added](https://twitter.com/easyrabbit_net/status/1057289620206088192) Decred support and allows for the exchange of DCR without an account.

Evercoin turned from an instant exchange into an app and no longer supports Decred, thus [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/389) from the [list of exchanges](https://decred.org/exchanges/).

Decred [is live](https://twitter.com/roomofsatoshi/status/1052879109099991041) on [Living Room of Satoshi](https://www.livingroomofsatoshi.com/). It allows one to pay any bill or to pay money into any Australian bank account with Decred. Established in 2014, the service helped to pay over 140,000 bills.

> Hi guys, just want to let you know that Decred is now live on [livingroomofsatoshi.com](https://www.livingroomofsatoshi.com/) . LRoS is a platform that Australians can use to pay any bill with cryptocurrency. We were getting quite a bit of interest from Decred users so we're happy to now have you onboard for Australians to use. (@RoomOfSatoshi in [#general](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$153985979832389MbrMp:decred.org))

## Adoption

New merchant: [Crypto Posters](https://www.cryptocurrencyposters.com/) offers [Decred merch](https://www.cryptocurrencyposters.com/coins/decred-merch/) (including socks!) and accepts DCR. You can talk to them [on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9qrqlh/decred_merchandise_from_a_site_that_actually/).

Brazilian presidential candidate Fernando Haddad [registered](https://www.obrasilfelizdenovo.com/haddad-blockchain-bitcoin-plano-governo/) his government plan on the Decred blockchain to prevent distortion and possible vote manipulation by fake news. Link to document certification is [here](https://originalmy.com/bitregistro/088e82f064705bd7d33fe708c1084b43898d5739fe7a5ff6bff14a9c0a889853). The story got covered by outlets like [criptomoedasfacil](https://www.criptomoedasfacil.com/candidato-a-presidencia-fernando-haddad-registra-seu-plano-de-governo-na-blockchain/), [criptonoticias](https://www.criptonoticias.com/registros-notarias/candidato-presidencial-brasil-registra-plan-gobierno-decred/) and [cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/brazilian-presidential-candidate-uses-blockchain-to-publish-government-plan) (_mention of Decred omitted_). Discussion on [r/decred](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9ofupt/brazilian_presidential_candidate_uses_decred/).

## Marketing

October was an exciting month for Decred, in large part due to the launch of Politeia. The [press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181016005342/en/Decred-Launches-Politeia-Self-Governance-System-Release-20-Million) was viewed by 2,615 unique addresses in 53 countries, and was used to publish dozens of stories on Decred's launch. Brady Dale of CoinDesk was granted an exclusive on the launch, and his article can be found [here](https://www.coindesk.com/decred-is-turning-its-entire-21-million-crypto-treasury-over-to-investors/).

In addition, multiple blog posts were released to support the Politeia launch, including [@Dustorf's](https://medium.com/decred/politeia-approaching-escape-velocity-30f95f8b2055) and [@richardred's](https://medium.com/decred/on-the-launch-of-decreds-politeia-b305d06d8bda).

Decred was a platinum sponsor at the Texas Bitcoin Conference in Austin on Oct 27-28. A strong mix of presenters converged to deliver some dynamic presentations on governance, Politeia specifically, staking, mining, and many other topics. Videos of the presentations can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaMrpvQ0yJ_x4L3vtUwfZOM6euh3P8-fx).

Much of the remainder of the month focused on vetting PR firms and facilitating proposals on Politeia.

> The right PR firm will help achieve our communications goals and protect our Treasury. The firms have the experience, discipline, and domain expertise to get us in the right places. Many people have commented positively about events. These typically cost $50-$100k per large scale event. Given the level of investment, it makes sense to be certain that we’re in the right places and then optimizing our presence through media outreach to schedule interviews for Decred community members on the right topics with the right media outlets.  
> There have been concerns about ceding control-messaging or content creation. That will not be the case. Both firms have agreed to work with us as team members in the writers room, and at the end of the day, the Decred community is the client with the final say. There will be a weekly conference call, and I think that all community members should have access to the call.  
> On that note, I’ll explain the process to this point because I think it’s demonstrative of what it will look like if a firm is selected to proceed. I suggested to @jy-p that the right PR resource would be of value for the aforementioned reasons. I researched and reviewed dozens of firms-crypto specific firms, fin-tech B2B firms, and bulge bracket firms. Quickly, I concluded that only crypto specific firms would possess the technical knowledge to help us in fewer than six months. Next, I interviewed six crypto PR firms and reduced the set to two. I coordinated multiple conference calls with no fewer than eight core community members to vet and question the firms. Collectively, we all agreed that these two firms would be capable of accomplishing our objectives, and we decided to have both of them submit proposals in Politeia so the community could decide. (@Dustorf in [#proposals](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$154023798936000RPDxl:decred.org))

The work to vet the PR firms will soon be detailed further in a blog by @Dustorf. Now that a PR firm has been approved (early Nov), work will begin to gain consensus within the community on messaging, and plans will begin on significant website updates and an integrated communications plan for 2019. Much more to share in November.

@zubairzia0 has taken on the LinkedIn page:

> the Decred page was there for a while but it was low in activity. I am currently helping on LinkedIn to increase presence on that platform as there is potential to attract professionals and firms that can become productive stakeholders. The Politeia page is a showcase page (like an extension page for spotlighting a part of the business), that started this Oct. Updates are vetted through a small group of contributors much like Twitter updates. I have made a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zubairzia0/Decred-research/tree/master/Linkedin) where we can collaborate on plans and activities, and I intend to store the analytics data there as LinkedIn limits export to the last 6 months. LinkedIn Learning is also on the radar where Decred courses can be offered (currently has Etheruem and Bitcoin courses). However, this requires that I or any interested individual apply to get on the LinkedIn Learning platform first. Recent stats for Decred page are 593 page views (+90%) and 276 unique visitors (+51%), and for Politeia page 78 page views and 16 unique visitors.

Targeted advertising report for October was posted by @timhebel. Politeia campaign is planned soon using some of the new graphics. Read more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9vb5tk/october_2018_targeted_ads_reports/).

* [Bitcoin Meetup CDMX](https://www.meetup.com/Bitcoin-Meetup-Ciudad-de-Mexico/events/255035235/) in Mexico City, Mexico. @elian hosted the event and [noted](https://matrix.to/#/!aNPTuiryMFmdMQWUzb:decred.org/$153893940023124lDnUR:decred.org): "of an audience of 30 people only 4 have heard before of Decred, everyone was so surprised to find such a high-quality project in crypto, also they where very interested in how Politeia will be use to deploy the R&D funds of Decred, about the hybrid consensus mechanism and how governance is structured in Decred, was definitely a great audience, looking forward to another meetup".

* [SF Blockchain Week](https://sfblockchainweek.io/) in San Francisco, USA. @lukebp was speaking on "Consensus Systems: DPos vs PoS".
* [Get FinTech](https://www.meetup.com/FinTech-and-digital-assets/events/248585942/) in Mexico City, Mexico. @elian [reports](https://matrix.to/#/!aNPTuiryMFmdMQWUzb:decred.org/$154163560411642sPiHv:decred.org): "As a resume from both meetups, the Mexican crypto community that attended (60+) the meetups was surprised and happy to know more about Decred (only 10% knew it from before). The cypherpunk ethos of the project, its decentralized and open source nature, the people behind it, its hybrid consensus and how it all started with an airdrop were among the topics people asked about. Also, many were intrigued by the possibilities that Politeia, the DCR fund and its governance mechanism could mean for the future of digital currencies and digital 'states' in an era when trust is being shifted from centralized institutions to community driven projects.".

I haven't found many where you have such access to the developers and where you can watch the changes being made on a daily basis.

## Markets

DCR was trading in the range of USDT 35-56 / BTC 0.0058-0.0085. The USDT base is used instead of the usual USD because as October has shown, the two can go out of sync in dramatic ways.

On Oct 15 a huge dump of USDT sent it below $0.8 on some exchanges and caused a corresponding spike of BTC up to USDT 7700. On Poloniex, panic sells of USDT reached USDC 0.51, and on Bittrex it went down to $0.87. The price held below $0.9 for around 12 hours, recovered to $0.97 by Oct 19 and to $0.98 by Oct 27. Media coverage is [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-14/why-crypto-traders-are-so-worried-about-tether-quicktake-q-a) and [here](https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-tanks-as-traders-lose-trust-other-cryptos-see-price-boost).

A 40% jump to USDT 56 / BTC 0.0085 happened after the announcement of DCR listing on Binance.

Numbers are from Poloniex and Bittrex.

Thankfully, someone [explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/9p3w4g/sia_hyperspace_sia_classic_and_sia_prime_a_whos/) the differences. Decred so far was quite good at avoiding ASIC-related conflicts of interest and at keeping the community together.
