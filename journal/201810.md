# {DRAFT} Decred Journal – October 2018

![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover text}")

Big news of the month is the historical moment: Politeia mainnet launch. Congratulations to everyone and thanks to Politeia team for the countless hours of work.

@jy-p noted that Politeia's great power can be used to improve Decred, but also lead to problems if used unwisely. To inform stakeholders, he shared his experiences as a custodian of the [Decred Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx). The [blog post](https://blog.decred.org/2018/10/15/Politeia-in-Production/) is highly recommended for stakeholders for all the insights and long it contains.

New software version 1.3.1 was released to allow everyone to participate in Politeia. It adds Governance page to Decredition for GUI users, and introduces a new `politeiavoter` tool for CLI users. Get the downloads on [GitHub](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.1) and don't forget to [verify signatures](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/blob/v1.3.1/README.md#verifying-binaries).

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

* Another big change towards multipeer downloads entered testing. It [optimizes](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1500) chain reorganization logic for the typical case and makes reorganizations use less memory.
* Regression network (regnet) was [resurrected](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1480) and several unit tests were [migrated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1481) to it. This allowed to separate concerns and [optimize](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1482) simnet setup.
* [This change](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1476) simplifies setting up dcrd on a separate machine.
* New [getblockchaininfo](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1479) RPC provides useful chain-related information that was previously unavailable.
* Go Report Card was added to README and as of writing it is [showing](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/decred/dcrd) A+ rating for the project.
* Various RPC, testing and infrastructure improvements.

A lot of mining-related improvements are [in the pipeline](https://matrix.to/#/!NNzHoaSdnsbZDQOXJr:decred.org/$154003890434385mrGTu:decred.org).

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): bug fixes.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): [Version 1.3.1](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.1) reveals SPV and Politeia functionality to all users. It also adds first batch of translations that include French, Spanish, German, Japanese and Chinese (simplified). If you are a long standing community member and notice any incorrect translations you can open an issue on github or contact the team on the slack/matrix chat platforms. To ensure high quality translations, some trust with the project is currently required to submit translation issues. At the same time, the procedures to allow input from more users is being formalized.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia):

* Multiple bug fixes and UI improvements.
* [Ability](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/538) for admins to specify quorum, pass threshold and vote duration.
* [Ability](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/537) to lock accounts that are abusing the system or for security reasons.
* [Ability](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/655) to revoke proposal vote authorization.
* Many community members joined testing and submitted dozens of issue reports after launch.

Up next is adding notifications and other missing features. Longer term plan is to scale Politeia and develop smart contracts for the Treasury.

[Android](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): design upgrades, bugfixes and stability improvements.

[iOS](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): design upgrades and bugfixes.

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata):

* Lots of work to speed up initial sync ([751](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/751), [754](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/754), [752](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/752)).
* Insight API [documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/719).
* Work ongoing for [new home page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/718) design.
* [Disapproved Blocks](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/733) page is in development.

Trezor: Decred support was merged into Model T firmware repository. Decrediton integration can be merged after the next firmware release. This is all for normal transactions. Buying tickets requires more work and changes to dcrwallet.

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): v0.6.2 released, the downloads and release notes are [on GitHub](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/releases/tag/v0.6.2). On the master branch OpenBSD support was added among a few internal improvements.

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): updated relevant documentation for the 1.3.1 release, added new [Decrediton troubleshooting](https://docs.decred.org/getting-started/user-guides/decrediton-troubleshooting/) page, [upgrade](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/601) of mkdocs and material theme allowed to simplify things.

Politeia documentation is nearing completion, SPV documentation is planned next.

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb): [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/370) outdated compare page that caused some controversy, code cleanup, updated press and exchanges. 5 contractors added and 1 removed.

[Design](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/releases): EETER updated Decred logo for better performance on digital screens. Check this [blog post](https://medium.com/decred/dcr-logo-performance-update-f12f94a7a33e) with details and comparison to old logo.

Did you know there are several [Decred packages](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&K=decred) in Arch User Repository?

There was a small [interruption](https://matrix.to/#/!VFRvyndKpzcLrVslQD:decred.org/$154021525435657VDmQn:decred.org) on GitHub that had a minor impact on work, but the developers are keeping an eye on GitHub.

Dev activity stats for October: 310 active PRs, 297 master commits, 65K added and 22K deleted lines spread across 8 repositories. Contributions came from 4-9 developers per repository. ([chart]({}))

## People

## Governance

We had a total of {6} proposals in Politeia in October.

1. @Richard-Red put forth a proposal on October 16, 2018 titled ["Decred Open Source Research"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c68bb790ba0843980bb9695de4628995e75e0d1f36c992951db49eca7b3b4bcd) it aims to seek funding for opensource research onto cryptocurrency and will involve multiple contributors. He is currently requesting for 10000 USD as an initial budget for a few months.

Current Status: Proposal voting active

2. @Richard-Red opened a proposal titled ["Change language: PoS Mining to PoS Voting, Stakepool to Voting Service Provider"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/522652954ea7998f3fca95b9c4ca8907820eb785877dcf7fba92307131818c75).

The proposal goes into detail on a method to handle adding new contractors, removal of contractors, contractor disputes and resolution. He suggested that it be based on existing contractors "voting". The voting power is determined by the number of hours they have billed in a given period of time. The estimated project cost is USD 25,000.

## Network

Hashrate: nearly doubled in October, starting the month around 80 and ending around 156 PH/s. The low was 73 and the high was 193 PH/s. BeePool's share varied between 20-50%, F2Pool 25-35%, Luxor 3-5% and Coinmine 3-4%. Unkown hashrate held between 20-30% with several spikes to 60%. Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was 99.8 DCR (+1.8). The price varied between 96.5 and 102.6 DCR. Locked amount was 3.94-4.06 million DCR, which corresponded to 46.0-46.6% of the available supply.

Third most tickets purchased in a 24 hour period in 2018 was [noticed](https://twitter.com/ImacallyouJawdy/status/1047894895434842112) on Oct 3.

On Oct 15 a huge dump of USDT caused it to drop below $0.8 on some exchanges, and a corresponding spike of BTC/USDT to 7700. On Poloniex, panic spikes on USDT/USDC reached 0.59. This happened just a few hours after a (fake) rumor of Binance delisting USDT circulated on Twitter.
