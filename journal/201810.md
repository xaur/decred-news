# {DRAFT} Decred Journal – October 2018

![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover text}")

## Development

Main news of the month is the historical moment of Politeia mainnet launch on Oct 15.

* https://blog.decred.org/2018/10/15/Politeia-in-Production/

@jy-p noted that Politeia's great power can be used to improve Decred, but also lead to problems if used unwisely. To inform stakeholders, he shared his experiences as a custodian of the Treasury. The post contains many insights and long term vision and is highly recommended for stakeholders to read.

Second highlight is Decrediton 1.3.1 release https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.1 {unroll key features} {note politeiavoter tool}

{per-project summary}

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): {}

another big change towards multipeer downloads https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1500 {add a bit of detail}

regnet resurrected https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1480 and majority of tests were migrated to it https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1481 . This allowed to separate concerns and optimize simnet setup https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1482

testing improvements https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1484 https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1485

stability improvements:

* clear shutdown https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1690
* clear shutdown in windows https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1679
* improved notifications https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1726
* improved startup time for large wallets https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1727

new languages: https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1697 {unroll}

Translations are challenging. In the past there was an attempt to do community translations and it had a lot of problems that led to a decision to use professional service. But that doesn't guarantee accurate translations that don't raise eyebrows of native speakers. Verifying translations to a language you don't speak is challenging. Therefore anyone is welcome to let the team know about poor quality translations.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia):

Received dozens of issue reports after launch.

* Ability to lock accounts that are abusing the system or for security reasons https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/537
* {worth?} ability to revoke prop vote auth https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/655

Up next is polishing and scaling Politeia, as well as developing a smart contract for the Treasury.

## Governance

We had a total of {4} proposals in Politeia this month. All of them are in the pre-voting stage.

1. @Richard-Red put forth a proposal on October 16, 2018 titled ["Decred Open Source Research"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c68bb790ba0843980bb9695de4628995e75e0d1f36c992951db49eca7b3b4bcd) it aims to seek funding for opensource research onto cryptocurrency and will involve multiple contributors. He is currently requesting for 10000 USD as an initial budget for a few months.

## Markets

{markets overview: USD and BTC prices, highs and lows, interesting events, interesting analysis}

On Oct 15 a huge dump of USDT caused it to drop below $0.8 on some exchanges, and a corresponding spike of BTC/USDT to 7700. On Poloniex, panic spikes on USDT/USDC reached 0.59. This happened just a few hours after a (fake) rumor of Binance delisting USDT circulated on Twitter.
