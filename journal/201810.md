# {DRAFT} Decred Journal – October 2018

![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover text}")

Big news of the month is the historical moment: Politeia mainnet launch. Congratulations to everyone and thanks to Politeia team for the countless hours of work.

@jy-p noted that Politeia's great power can be used to improve Decred, but could also lead to problems if used unwisely. To inform stakeholders, he shared his experiences as a custodian of the [Decred Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx). His [blog post](https://blog.decred.org/2018/10/15/Politeia-in-Production/) is highly recommended for stakeholders for all the insights it contains.

New software version 1.3.1 was released to allow everyone to participate in Politeia. It adds Governance page to Decredition for GUI users, and introduces a new `politeiavoter` tool for CLI users. Get the downloads on [GitHub](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.1) and don't forget to [verify signatures](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/blob/v1.3.1/README.md#verifying-binaries).

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

* Another big step towards multipeer downloads entered testing. It [optimizes](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1500) chain reorganization logic for the typical case and makes reorganizations use less memory.
* Regression network (regnet) was [resurrected](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1480) and several unit tests were [migrated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1481) to it. This allowed to separate concerns and [optimize](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1482) simnet setup.
* [This change](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1476) simplifies setting up dcrd on a separate machine.
* New [getblockchaininfo](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1479) RPC provides useful chain-related information that was previously unavailable.
* Go Report Card was added to README and as of writing it is [showing](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/decred/dcrd) A+ rating for the project.
* Various RPC, testing and infrastructure improvements.

A lot of mining-related improvements are [in the pipeline](https://matrix.to/#/!NNzHoaSdnsbZDQOXJr:decred.org/$154003890434385mrGTu:decred.org).

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): bug fixes.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): [Version 1.3.1](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.1) reveals SPV and Politeia functionality to all users. It also adds first batch of translations that include French, Spanish, German, Japanese and Chinese (simplified). If you are a long standing community member and notice any incorrect translations you can open an issue on GitHub or contact the team on the slack/matrix chat platforms. To ensure high quality translations, some reputation with the project is currently required to submit translation issues. At the same time, the procedures to allow input from more users are being formalized.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): [ability](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/538) for admins to specify voting parameters (quorum, pass threshold and vote duration), [ability](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/537) to lock accounts that are abusing the system or for security reasons, [ability](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/655) to revoke proposal vote authorization. Multiple bug fixes and UI improvements. Many community members joined testing and submitted dozens of issue reports after launch.

Up next is adding notifications and other missing features. Longer term plan is to scale Politeia and develop smart contracts for the Treasury.

[Android](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): dcrandroid gained a PIN security option in addition to the existing password option for spending security. Another security feature is full wallet encryption and requiring the PIN/password to access the wallet. Android 9 support was added. The testnet version is now available to beta testers [on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.testnet), and they will automatically receive updates. A new testnet version is being pushed now. Several bugs and priority enhancements were done based on feedback from the last testing round. Testing for the mainnet release is being done.

[iOS](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): all crashing issues are resolved, and effort will be focused on getting it out to a larger testing audience and targeting a release after the Android release is out the door.

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): work to speed up initial sync ([751](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/751), [754](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/754), [752](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/752)), [disapproved blocks](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/733) page, Insight API [documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/719) by @s_ben, new visual blocks [home page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/718) by @itswisdomagain, time grouped [block listing](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/779). The newly merged features will be deployed in future releases.

Trezor: Decred support was [merged](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-core/pull/358) into Model T firmware repository. Decrediton integration can be merged after the next firmware release. This is all for normal transactions. Buying tickets requires more work and changes to dcrwallet.

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): v0.6.2 released, the downloads and release notes are [on GitHub](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/releases/tag/v0.6.2). On the master branch OpenBSD support was added among a few internal improvements.

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): updated relevant documentation for the 1.3.1 release, added new [Decrediton troubleshooting](https://docs.decred.org/getting-started/user-guides/decrediton-troubleshooting/) page, [upgrade](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/601) of mkdocs and material theme will simplify things.

Politeia documentation is nearing completion, SPV documentation is planned next.

[Design](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/releases): EETER updated Decred logo for better performance on digital screens. Check this [blog post](https://medium.com/decred/dcr-logo-performance-update-f12f94a7a33e) with details and comparison to old logo.

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb): [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/370) outdated compare page that caused some controversy, code cleanup, updated press and exchanges. 5 contractors added and 1 removed.

Did you know there are several [Decred packages](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&K=decred) in Arch User Repository?

There was a small [interruption](https://matrix.to/#/!VFRvyndKpzcLrVslQD:decred.org/$154021525435657VDmQn:decred.org) on GitHub that had a minor impact on work, but the developers are keeping an eye on GitHub.

Dev activity stats for October: 310 active PRs, 297 master commits, 65K added and 22K deleted lines spread across 8 repositories. Contributions came from 4-9 developers per repository. ([chart](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1060274048481906688))

## People

## Governance

We had a total of 7 proposals on Politeia in October.

1. @Richard-Red put forth a proposal on October 16, 2018 titled ["Decred Open Source Research"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c68bb790ba0843980bb9695de4628995e75e0d1f36c992951db49eca7b3b4bcd) it aims to seek funding for open source research and will involve multiple contributors. He is currently requesting for 10,000 USD as an initial budget for a few months.

   Current Status: Proposal voting active

2. @Richard-Red opened a proposal titled ["Change language: PoS Mining to PoS Voting, Stakepool to Voting Service Provider"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/522652954ea7998f3fca95b9c4ca8907820eb785877dcf7fba92307131818c75). The proposal asks that changes be made to some common terminology related to Decred's Proof of Stake Voting.

   Current Status: Proposal voting active

3. @jy-p submitted a proposal titled ["Decred Contractor Clearance Process"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4). The proposal goes into detail on a method to handle adding new contractors, removal of contractors, contractor disputes and resolution. He suggested that it be based on existing contractors vouching for new contractors in their domain making decisions among the people who work in a given domain. Where that fails a dispute can be escalated to a contractor vote, wherein contractors would vote weighted by the number of hours they have billed in a given period of time. A Stakeholder vote would be a last resort to resolve a dispute. The estimated project cost is USD 25,000, for work on a system for tracking contractors within domains and who has vouched for who.

   Current Status: Author has not yet authorized the start of voting

4. A user "hashfunction8" submitted a proposal named ["Testing of the funding-request mechanism by a non expert"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/3575a65bbc3616c939acf6edf801e1168485dc864efef910034268f695351b5d) in which the user asked for 0.1 DCR to reimburse their proposal fee, in exchange they would document how to use the proposal submission form.

## Network

Hashrate: nearly doubled in October, starting the month around 80 and ending around 156 PH/s. The low was 73 and the high was 193 PH/s. BeePool's share varied between 20-50%, F2Pool 25-35%, Luxor 3-5% and Coinmine 3-4%. Unkown hashrate held between 20-30% with several spikes to 60%. Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was 99.8 DCR (+1.8). The price varied between 96.5 and 102.6 DCR. Locked amount was 3.94-4.06 million DCR, which corresponded to 46.0-46.6% of the available supply.

Third most tickets purchased in a 24 hour period in 2018 was [noticed](https://twitter.com/ImacallyouJawdy/status/1047894895434842112) on Oct 3.

Nodes: as of Oct 31 there are 202 public listening nodes and 323 normal nodes per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats). Version distribution: 6% are v1.4.0(pre) dev builds (+1%), 45% on v1.3.0 (+15%), 28% on v1.2.0 (-14%), 14% on v1.1.2 (-1%), 5% on v1.1.0 (-1%).

## Mining

Obelisk posted two updates on their [mailing list](https://us16.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=393b2698d17bdfe48ac0422ac&id=87ef82fd96). Batch 1 has shipped, Batch 2-5 production is expected to begin shortly and will take about 6 weeks to build and ship, Obelisk pledged to mine no more than 2% of network hashrate (down from 20%), an article detailing [compensation policy](http://support.obelisk.tech/article/utx5ropgxt-compensation-policy) was posted, firmware update v1.2.0 was [released](https://obelisk.tech/downloads.html). DCR1 owners will be able to purchase SC1 upgrade boards and convert their units into Sia miners.

Meet StrongU, a new mining manufacturer who released two units:

* [STU-U1](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/strongu/stu-u1) has 11 TH/s at 1600 W, price around $1,400.
* [STU-U1+](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/strongu/stu-u1-1) has 12.8 TH/s at 1850 W, price around $1,600.

[@i2Rav](https://decred.slack.com/team/U9G4L5QTH) on behalf of i2 Trading offers Whatsminer D1 machines for purchase. Additionally they can host the units in their facility in China. DCR is accepted for both services. Reach out to him on Slack for details.

Iterative and their Chinese partner Mega Pool started a Megapool VSP and are soon to launch a PoW pool. They are hoping to provide a full suite of services for Decred stakeholders, from mining equipment and pools, all the way down to liquidation services of DCR into fiat or BTC.

## Integrations

Welcome _three_ new voting service providers, making a total of 20:

* [stakey.com](https://stakey.com) with 1% fee (do not confuse with [stakey.net](https://stakey.net/)).
* [dcrpos.megapool.info](https://dcrpos.megapool.info/) with 1% fee.
* [dcrstake.coinmine.pl](https://dcrstake.coinmine.pl/) with 0.5% fee.

[decredvoting.com](https://decredvoting.com) now supports automatic [email notification](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9oepq6/decredvotingcom_now_supporting_automatic_email/) for full and split tickets. Also it [added](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9qv235/voting_service_provider_decredvotingcom_is_now/) a 4th server in central Europe, in addition to 3 servers in the US.

[dcr.farm](https://dcr.farm/) recently [voted](https://matrix.to/#/!wSdymYrEpBhsWlDJuk:decred.org/$153991704133210OjYNP:decred.org) on its 10,000th ticket. To celebrate, they added a 6th voting wallet located in Japan.

Exchange integrations:

* [gate.io](https://www.gate.io/) [announced](https://twitter.com/gate_io/status/1049238635189391361) the addition of DCR trading against BTC and USDT.
* [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) [added](https://twitter.com/binance/status/1054572693725446144) DCR trading against BTC and BNB, [noting](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1054573983805423616) it as a "strong community project". Discussed on [r/binance](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/9qle8z/dcr_on_binance/) and [r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9qlac1/binance_just_announced_they_are_listing_decred_26/).
* [Easyrabbit](https://easyrabbit.net/) [added](https://twitter.com/easyrabbit_net/status/1057289620206088192) Decred support and allows for the exchange of DCR without an account.

Evercoin turned from an instant exchange into an app and no longer supports Decred, thus [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/389) from the [list of exchanges](https://decred.org/exchanges/).

Decred [is live](https://twitter.com/roomofsatoshi/status/1052879109099991041) on [Living Room of Satoshi](https://www.livingroomofsatoshi.com/). It allows one to pay any bill or to pay money into any Australian bank account with Decred. Established in 2014, the service helped to pay over 140,000 bills.

> Hi guys, just want to let you know that Decred is now live on [livingroomofsatoshi.com](https://www.livingroomofsatoshi.com/) . LRoS is a platform that Australians can use to pay any bill with cryptocurrency. We were getting quite a bit of interest from Decred users so we're happy to now have you onboard for Australians to use. (@RoomOfSatoshi in [#general](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$153985979832389MbrMp:decred.org))

## Adoption

New merchant: [Crypto Posters](https://www.cryptocurrencyposters.com/) offers [Decred merch](https://www.cryptocurrencyposters.com/coins/decred-merch/) (including socks!) and accepts DCR. You can talk to them [on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9qrqlh/decred_merchandise_from_a_site_that_actually/).

Brazilian presidential candidate Fernando Haddad [registered](https://www.obrasilfelizdenovo.com/haddad-blockchain-bitcoin-plano-governo/) his government plan on the Decred blockchain to prevent distortion and possible vote manipulation by fake news. Link to document certification is [here](https://originalmy.com/bitregistro/088e82f064705bd7d33fe708c1084b43898d5739fe7a5ff6bff14a9c0a889853). The story got covered by outlets like [criptomoedasfacil](https://www.criptomoedasfacil.com/candidato-a-presidencia-fernando-haddad-registra-seu-plano-de-governo-na-blockchain/), [criptonoticias](https://www.criptonoticias.com/registros-notarias/candidato-presidencial-brasil-registra-plan-gobierno-decred/) and [cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/brazilian-presidential-candidate-uses-blockchain-to-publish-government-plan) (_mention of Decred omitted_). Discussion on [r/decred](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9ofupt/brazilian_presidential_candidate_uses_decred/).

## Marketing

October was an exciting month for Decred, in large part due to the launch of Politeia. The [press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181016005342/en/Decred-Launches-Politeia-Self-Governance-System-Release-20-Million) was viewed by 2,615 unique addresses in 53 countries, and was used to publish dozens of stories on Decred's launch. Brady Dale of CoinDesk was granted an exclusive on the launch, and his article can be found [here](https://www.coindesk.com/decred-is-turning-its-entire-21-million-crypto-treasury-over-to-investors/).

In addition, multiple blog posts were released to support the Politeia launch, including [Dustorf's](https://medium.com/decred/politeia-approaching-escape-velocity-30f95f8b2055) and [Richard Red's](https://medium.com/decred/on-the-launch-of-decreds-politeia-b305d06d8bda).

Decred was a platinum sponsor at the Texas Bitcoin Conference in Austin on Oct 27-28. A large team converged to deliver some dynamic presentations on governance, Politeia specifically, staking, mining, and many other topics. Videos of the presentations can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaMrpvQ0yJ_x4L3vtUwfZOM6euh3P8-fx).

Much of the remainder of the month focused on vetting PR firms and facilitating proposals on Politeia, which will soon be detailed further in a blog by @Dustorf. Now that a PR firm has been approved (early Nov), work will begin to gain consensus within the community on messaging, and plans will begin on significant website updates and an integrated communications plan for 2019. Much more to share in November.

@zubairzia0 has taken on the LinkedIn page:

> the Decred page was there for a while but it was low in activity. I am currently helping on LinkedIn to increase presence on that platform as there is potential to attract professionals and firms that can become productive stakeholders. The Politeia page is a showcase page (like an extention page for spotlighting a part of the business), that started in Oct. Also I have made a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zubairzia0/Decred-research/tree/master/Linkedin) for LinkedIn where we can collaborate on plans and activities, also I will store the analytics export there monthly. LinkedIn Learning is also on the radar where Decred courses can be offered (currently has Etheruem and Bitcoin courses). Recent stats for Decred page are 593 page views (+90%) and 276 unique visitors (+51%), and for Politeia page 78 page views and 16 unique visitors.

Targeted advertising report for October was posted by @timhebel. Politeia campaign is planned soon using some of the new graphics. Read more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9vb5tk/october_2018_targeted_ads_reports/).

The cypherpunk ethos of the project, its decentralized and open source nature, the people behind it, its hybrid consensus and how it all started with an airdrop were among the topics people asked about. Also, many were intrigued by the possibilities that Politeia, the DCR fund and its governance mechanism could mean for the future of digital currencies and digital 'states' in an era when trust is being shifted from centralized institutions to community driven projects.".

## Markets

DCR was trading in the range of USDT 35-56 / BTC 0.0058-0.0085. The USDT base is used instead of the usual USD becase as October has shown, the two can go out of sync in dramatic ways.

On Oct 15 a huge dump of USDT sent it below $0.8 on some exchanges and caused a corresponding spike of BTC up to USDT 7700. On Poloniex, panic sells of USDT reached USDC 0.51, and on Bittrex it went down to $0.87. The price held below $0.9 for around 12 hours, recovered to $0.97 by Oct 19 and to $0.98 by Oct 27. Media coverage is [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-14/why-crypto-traders-are-so-worried-about-tether-quicktake-q-a) and [here](https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-tanks-as-traders-lose-trust-other-cryptos-see-price-boost).

A 40% jump to USDT 56 / BTC 0.0085 happened after the announcement of DCR listing on Binance.

Numbers are from Poloniex and Bittrex.
