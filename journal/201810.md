# {DRAFT} Decred Journal – October 2018

![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover text}")

## Development

Main news of the month is the historical moment of Politeia mainnet launch on Oct 15.

* https://blog.decred.org/2018/10/15/Politeia-in-Production/

@jy-p noted that Politeia's great power can be used to improve Decred, but also lead to problems if used unwisely. To inform stakeholders, he shared his experiences as a custodian of the Treasury. The post contains many insights and long term vision and is highly recommended for stakeholders to read.

Second highlight is Decrediton 1.3.1 release https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.1 {unroll key features} {note politeiavoter tool}

{per-project summary}

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): {}

another big change towards multipeer downloads https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1500 {add a bit of detail}

regnet resurrected https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1480 and majority of tests were migrated to it https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1481 . This allowed to separate concerns and optimize simnet setup https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1482

testing improvements https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1484 https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1485

stability improvements:

* clear shutdown https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1690
* clear shutdown in windows https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1679
* improved notifications https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1726
* improved startup time for large wallets https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1727

new languages: https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1697 {unroll}

Translations are challenging. In the past there was an attempt to do community translations and it had a lot of problems that led to a decision to use professional service. But that doesn't guarantee accurate translations that don't raise eyebrows of native speakers. Verifying translations to a language you don't speak is challenging. Therefore anyone is welcome to let the team know about poor quality translations.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia):

Received dozens of issue reports after launch.

* Ability to lock accounts that are abusing the system or for security reasons https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/537
* {worth?} ability to revoke prop vote auth https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/655

Up next is polishing and scaling Politeia, as well as developing a smart contract for the Treasury.

## Governance

We had a total of {6} proposals in Politeia this month.

1. @Richard-Red put forth a proposal on October 16, 2018 titled ["Decred Open Source Research"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c68bb790ba0843980bb9695de4628995e75e0d1f36c992951db49eca7b3b4bcd) it aims to seek funding for opensource research onto cryptocurrency and will involve multiple contributors. He is currently requesting for 10000 USD as an initial budget for a few months.

Current Status: Proposal voting active

2. @Richard-Red opened a proposal titled ["Change language: PoS Mining to PoS Voting, Stakepool to Voting Service Provider"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/522652954ea7998f3fca95b9c4ca8907820eb785877dcf7fba92307131818c75). The proposal asks that changes be made to some common terminologies in the decred staking process.

Current Status: Proposal voting active

3. @jy-p submitted a proposal titled ["Decred Contractor Clearance Process"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4). The proposal goes into detail on a method to handle adding new contractors, removal of contractors, contractor disputes and resolution. He suggested that it be based on existing contractors "voting". The voting power is determined by the number of hours they have billed in a given period of time. The estimated project cost is USD 25,000.

Current Status: Author has not yet authorized the start of voting

4. A user "hashfunction8" had a proposal named ["Testing of the funding-request mechanism by a non expert"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/3575a65bbc3616c939acf6edf801e1168485dc864efef910034268f695351b5d) in which the user asked for 0.1 DCR to document and write a report on how to use the politeia system.

Current Status: Author has not yet authorized the start of voting

Finally we had two professional PR companies submit proposals for managing the PR of Decred, both proposals had multiple revisions based on community feedback.

Decred [is live](https://twitter.com/roomofsatoshi/status/1052879109099991041) on [Living Room of Satoshi](https://www.livingroomofsatoshi.com/). It allows to pay any bill or to any Australian bank account with Decred. Established in 2014, the service helped to pay over 140,000 bills.

> Hi guys, just want to let you know that Decred is now live on www.livingroomofsatoshi.com . LRoS is a platform that Australians can use to pay any bill with cryptocurrency. We were getting quite a bit of interest from Decred users so we're happy to now have you onboard for Australians to use.

ShapeShift and Evercoin which used to provide accountless trading for DCR are on the [way](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/05/shapeshift-cryptocurrency-exchange-kyc/) of adding mandatory accounts.

## Markets

{markets overview: USD and BTC prices, highs and lows, interesting events, interesting analysis}

On Oct 15 a huge dump of USDT caused it to drop below $0.8 on some exchanges, and a corresponding spike of BTC/USDT to 7700. On Poloniex, panic spikes on USDT/USDC reached 0.59. This happened just a few hours after a (fake) rumor of Binance delisting USDT circulated on Twitter.
