{introduction, major news of the month ordered by impact, don't put any links here}

Highlights for March:

- Yearly budgets for US/English and Brazilian outreach approved, {}K in total.
- First atomic swap trade on testnet coordinated by the DEX.
- This is the 24th issue which means that DJ has just turned 2 years!

## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the status "merged to master". It means that the work is completed, reviewed and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

- ECDSA signatures [decoupled](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2139) from secp256k1 package to make it clear that ECDSA is only one possible digital signature algorithm, and to enable Schnorr signatures to be made first class citizens of the codebase 
- exported [field value type](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2134) to allow external callers to perform optimized field math
- signature verification further optimized by minimizing expensive operations 
- added method to [clear](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2117) private key from memory and [reduced](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2131) number of internal copies of private keys to enhance security against memory scraping
- big integers [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2107) completely from signature parsing and signing operations in favor of the specialized mod n scalar code
- schnorr verification tests [reworked](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2128) to resolve multiple issues
- prevented the misuse of code in several areas
- removed unused code

A vulnerability was [disclosed](https://bounty.decred.org/2020/03/status-update/) that allowed a potential multi-day memory exhaustion attack that could lead to a node crash in dcrd v1.4.0. On Mar 13 the network forked to new consensus rules implemented in dcrd v1.5.0 which means all nodes on the network are required to run that as a minimum version. Since this and later versions contain a fix for the vulnerability, it is now mitigated.

dcrd has less than 16% code overlap with btcd meaning that 84% is the new development work, according to an [analysis](https://coincode.sh/c/dcr/) by CoinCode.sh. @davecgh [confirmed](https://matrix.to/#/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$15862843869377LGlSK:decred.org) that the numbers look plausible given how much new code has been written and noted that the divergence is even more pronounced in dcrwallet (which was not analyzed).

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

- `fundrawtransaction` command [implemented](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1706) that adds unsigned inputs and change output to a raw transaction
- wallet operations [switched](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1648) to use version 2 commited filters (v1 filters are deprecated but are still served by the network and used by dcrwallet, next release will use v2 filters)
- `getaddressesbyaccount` command [fixed](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1695) to also return imported addresses for the `imported` account
- unencrypted P2SH redeem scripts are [moved](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1688) to address manager storage. This simplifies storage and removes the requirement to unlock the wallet to view or store the scripts.
- internal improvements to efficiency and semantics
- cleanup to remove deprecated and unused code

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton):

- support for [cold staking](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2424) (work towards Trezor staking) { is it full support tangible by the user or one step to it? if the latter, clarify what exactly is added. and what is the ticket signing flow with this cold staking? }
- support for [importing scripts](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2423) in watch-only wallets
- retrieve passed [agendas](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2442) from dcrdata
- check for [new proposals](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2420) on the Governance tab
- responsive [proposal view](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2444), [address](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2416) display on overview and transaction views, and other UI tweaks

In development:

- [CoinShuffle++](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2452) support

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia):

- [invalidate](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1159) sessions on password change
- test improvements and bug fixes

tlog integration has begun and is [projected](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/1112#issuecomment-606147106) to take ~2 months. In [July 2019](201907.md#development) we've inaccurately reported the start of tlog integration but that work was actually a reference implementation to serve as a proof of concept and demonstrate that Google's [Trillian](https://github.com/google/trillian) data store can replace existing Git backend. It was [merged](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/951) in August and contained a [client/server](https://github.com/decred/politeia/tree/master/tlog) with basic functionality for storing documents. This experience gave enough instight to know that it will work. Next step is to actually write a Politeia backend that uses Trillian.

Major advantages of the tlog backend is it will make Politeia more scalable and allow to censor content after it's been made public, while keeping the audit trail of all data ever submitted. It will also allow a proper fix of the duplicate comments bug.

CMS:

- ability to assign proposal [ownership](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1135), which will be used in upcoming changes to let proposal owners see what is billed against their proposal
- ability to [deactivate](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1154) temporary contractor account on paid invoice and require admin approval to allow another invoice
- [preload](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1829) user info to assist in authoring invoices
- redesign work started in October finally [merged](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1828). This large change adds 9K and deletes 24K lines of code.
  - { any comments? what is pi-ui and what motivated it? why redesign is neccessary for an internal system, or is it more than just a new skin? dark mode? }

[dcrstakepool](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool):

- code maintenance to improve error handling and cancellation, add documentation, upgrade dependencies and add tests

[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool):

- added support for [Obelisk DCR1](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/issues/110)
- pool database is [backed up](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/164) before shutdown
- added [pagination](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/163) for mined blocks
- connection code [refactored](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/171) to simplify testing
- increased test coverage
- smaller improvements to UX, config and a few bug fixes
- the work is a preparation for an upcoming 1.1.0 release

[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd):

- build system [improvements](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/84)

In development:

- new [chainscan](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/83) package that uses committed filters to detect transactions relevant for the LN node more efficiently and can also operate in SPV mode
- [implementations](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/92) for chainntnfs package that use embedded and remote dcrwallet as a source of chain events. This allows to further decouple dcrlnd from an underlying dcrd, which is a requirement for having a dcrlnd instance running in SPV mode.
- building on the above, enable and test [SPV mode](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/95) for remote wallets ("remote wallet" is the connection mode where dcrlnd connects to an already running dcrwallet instance, i.e. does not need its own embedded wallet with a separate seed)

> SPV mode is a requirement for mobile LN wallets. It's likely SPV will be the dominant sync mode even in desktop wallets, so it's essential for dcrlnd to support SPV mode. It's also the last item of the "immediate work" section of my "roadmap" of sorts that I outlined in the [announcement post](https://matheusd.com/post/announcing-dcrlnd/) for LN, so this concludes the majority of the porting effort from lnd to dcrlnd. Concluding SPV means we can start exploring more exotic changes that are available in Decred (such as [PTLCs](https://suredbits.com/payment-points-monotone-access-structures/) which depend on the Schnorr work that @davecgh is also concluding). ([@matheusd](https://matrix.to/#/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$1586258547807544APZNe:matrix.org))

[dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex):

- [RPC client](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/181) for DEX client's RPC server (_ouch_)
- ability to [place orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/195) through the GUI
- client account [backup and restore](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/210) { how is this different from 183 reported in Feb? }
- { handling of `epoch_order` (188) and `match_proof` (189) - is it notable? if yes, how to present? }
- added [match negotiation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/213) { is it client, server or both? anything to add to better explain this change? }
- added [cancellation ratio](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/206) computation to track if clients abuse order cancellation
- codebase refactoring and cleanup

A total of 19 pull requests merged from 6 contributors adding 11K and deleting 3K lines of code (commit summary [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/compare/94310f66c06fdf5ca31eeb80c9f6af7aecf4c31d...d3bd07f822200041092bdc85f5c1b752b3c9ee24)).

## Governance

In March the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 13,713 DCR and spent 17,153 DCR. Using March's daily average DCR/USD rate of $13.40, this is $184K received and $230K spent. At February's average daily rate of $20.48, the USD figure billed for work completed in that month is $281K. As of Apr 3, Treasury balance is 640K DCR (7.41 million USD at $11.58).

This month saw the publication of 4 new proposals.

The new [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2f08f8518bc7672069a10ac6461fd9ab341d4a9e4c343fd4a7ec426250f3896f) from the DCRComic team requested an increased budget of $16,200 for 12 more comics plus supporting activity, with an extra $150 per comic added for extra time spent adapting the assets for social media use. The proposal has since been put on [hold](https://twitter.com/DCRComic/status/1243197581104041984) to reformulate the cast of characters, after some criticism that Stakey was being over-used in representing many different roles in the Decred ecosystem.

The US Marketing [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c830ea5afea45a0aabf4092d1bea51fb10b8bfa2d8474aac03224f0f94d3d1af) was, after being edited down to $177,800 to remove the community organizing of events in light of COVID-19, approved with 74% support and voter turnout of 31%.

The Brazilian marketing [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/bc20f986c3ea2fed2ea074c377a89f1a4b956ea0d527a8b6c099a5a8f175beb5), which requests $108K for the rest of the year was also approved, with 65% support and turnout of 34%. This proposal was edited to say that events will not be organized or billed for while the COVID-19 situation persists, but the item was not removed from the budget and some of this activity may take place later in the year.

Two further proposals were submitted and are under discussion. A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d3b16861a7e555db2fdd25b589123f4b6c4289c857fbdff329a4ffb1cb60c4d9) from PolisPay App seeks $5,000 to support DCR. There is also a [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/7d42c6f4bf3059b64789185af615c1df97cb61a379425933be5ff01d074ed4d5) to fund the Decred Daily twitter [account](https://twitter.com/Decred_Daily) for 6 months and make a website for it (total budget $5,280).

The Market Making proposal from i2 Trading is nearing the end of the six months of market making activity, this commenced in late October 2019 and so will come to an end in late April 2020. i2's trading logs continue to be audited monthly by Company 0 and performance has been found to be satisfactory. i2 are planning to submit a proposal to continue MM activity for Decred, but it will be scaled down to reflect the current market conditions.

@bee has extensively [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/fa70c3/decred_2019_marketing_report/) on the 2019 Marketing Report and shared his vision for moving forward.

## Network

Hashrate: [March's hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=k73pwcch-k8jayo3s&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~359 Ph/s and closed ~309 Ph/s, bottoming at 274 Ph/s and peaking at 556 Ph/s throughout the month. Pool [hashrate distribution](https://dcrstats.com/pow) as of Apr 1: UUPool 55%, Poolin 18%, lab.antpool.com 17%, Luxor 2.5%, BTC.com 2.2%, F2Pool 1.5%, BeePool 0.13%, CoinMine 0.08%, Suprnova 0.02% and others ~3.8%. Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Staking: [30-day average](https://dcrstats.com/) ticket price was 141.9 DCR (+9.8). The [price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=k73pwcch-k8jayo3s&bin=window&axis=time) varied between 130.9-166.8 DCR. [Locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=k73pwcch-k8jayo3s&bin=block&axis=time) was 5.50-5.75 million DCR, which corresponded to 49.05-51.27% [participation](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=k73pwcch-k8jayo3s&bin=block&axis=time) of the available supply.

The ticket price topped at 166.82 which is again a new high since the stake difficulty algorithm change.

Block size: This month, the blockchain size grew by 129 MB. Blocks had an average [size](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=block-size&zoom=k73pwcch-k8jayo3s&bin=block&axis=time) of 14.5 KB. The smallest block had a size of 1.62 KB and the largest one, 374.98 KB. So far the major source of nearly full blocks is the Treasury: this month the payouts created a range of 9 full blocks on [Mar 16](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/blocks?height=432590&rows=20).

Transactions: In March, Decred users made 49,078 regular transactions and bought 44,149 tickets. 43,791 tickets were rewarded for voting and 728 were revoked. On average, there were 1,583 regular DCR transactions and 1,424 new tickets per day.

Nodes: Throughout [March](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=1583020800000&to=1585699200000) there was an average of 146 public listening nodes and 246 total nodes per dcr.farm. Average version distribution for Mar: 28% dcrd v1.5.1, 20% dcrd v1.4, 15% dcrd v1.5, 8% dcrd v1.5 dev and RC builds, 5% dcrwallet v1.5.1, 5% dcrwallet v1.4, 2% dcrwallet v1.5. On Mar 13 the new consensus rules activated and after that dcrd v1.4 can no longer follow the chain.

## Integrations

Probit [added](https://twitter.com/ProBit_Exchange/status/1235450770100649986) support for DCR/KRW and DCR/USDT pairs to their exchange.

Exmo.com had a sudden DCR [outage](https://twitter.com/Exmo_Com/status/1240255377507303431) a few days after the Mar 13 fork, the services [resumed](https://twitter.com/Exmo_Com/status/1240627750005870592) the next day. Currently Exmo is the only integration [funded](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/950e8149e594b01c010c1199233ab11e82c9da39174ba375d286dc72bb0a54d7) by stakeholders.

[NOWPayments](https://nowpayments.io/) payment processor that was launched in 2019 by ChangeNOW supports DCR among [40+](https://nowpayments.io/supported-coins/) other assets.

ChainRift [announced](https://twitter.com/ChainRift/status/1228010062163202049) in Feb that they will be shutting down exchange operations and pivoting to a software development company.

DCR was [added](https://twitter.com/Checkmatey/status/1244030247558729729) to FTX PRIV-PERP index future contract that tracks a basket of 9 privacy coins. Index calculation can be found [here](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027668812-Index-Calculation).

User AGspearo was not able to access their [funds](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/fim5j2/stakepool_failure_caused_me_to_lose_all_my/) due to the VSP d1pool.com shutting down without notice and them not having access to their redeem script. AGspearo spent a lot of time on support trying to resolve this issue but ultimately they were unable to get their funds. @davecgh broke down the issue as a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/fim5j2/stakepool_failure_caused_me_to_lose_all_my/fkiac45) and also said a possible consensus change might solve these [issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/fim5j2/stakepool_failure_caused_me_to_lose_all_my/fkku35k).  If you are reading this and do not have your redeem scripts backed up please take this a warning and do a [backup](https://docs.decred.org/wallets/decrediton/using-decrediton/#backup-redeem-script) and store it along with your seed.

Some VSPs that had broken signup pages/out of date/returning errors had been [put on notice](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajholdstock+created%3A2020-03-01..2020-03-31) that they will be removed. Some of them have responded and fixed the issues. raqamiya.net, tokensmart.io and dcrpos.idcray.com have been removed since they failed to respond.

Most questions were about Decred's PoS voting system. Those who had some prior knowledge of crypto asked how to stake, and those who didn't wanted to know more about voting rights and what can stakeholders do with their tickets. About third of ~15 people were new to the project. ([report](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/blob/master/reports/20200312-hablemosdecred-01-internet.md))

Selected Reddit posts:

- /u/oiezz has suggested using the monthly Journal posts as discussion spaces, and last month's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/fgo0p4/decred_journal_february_2020/) has accumulated 18 comments.

- @bee has [compiled](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/frqkt0/your_favorite_misconceptions_about_decred_in_one/) "Your favorite misconceptions about Decred in one place"

- A [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/fhrsqn/austerity_mindset/fkd6nrn/) from /u/Corp-Por asking whether Decred should adopt an austerity mindset with Treasury funds had 22 comments and a score of 7. Most of the commenters were not as keen as the OP to make drastic changes, citing the Treasury's ample reserves and capacity to maintain funding at current rates for 5 years.

- A [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/frb863/next_privacy_iteration_how_private_and_fungible/) asking about Decred's next privacy iteration had @jy-p respond to say that the approach is to pick the low-hanging fruit (Decrediton support, PQ-security), continue to increase mixing uptake, then re-visit questions about how to enhance privacy further.

- @davecgh [responded](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/fim5j2/stakepool_failure_caused_me_to_lose_all_my/) to the unfortunate story of a Decred stakeholder who has lost access to their staked DCR because the VSP they were using went offline, their Decrediton machine was destroyed, and they had not saved the redeem script (see details [here](https://docs.decred.org/wallets/decrediton/using-decrediton/#backup-redeem-script)). @davecgh explained that the the redeem script is shared with the VSP as a multi-sig where either the user or VSP can redeem locked DCR and revoke tickets. As redeem scripts are re-used and revealed when the first ticket is redeemed, this stuck DCR scenario can only occur when the wallet of the user or VSP has never been online to redeem any of the tickets that used it. Once a single ticket has been redeemed by that wallet/VSP combination, the script is effectively stored in the blockchain.

  

Selected Twitter discussions:

- @swack lost his hammer and tweeted this [thread](https://twitter.com/swack0/status/1239674494526111747) about Decred as the only non-Bitcoin cryptoasset that deserves consideration as SoV and fiat alternative, citing adaptability, sustainability, and lack of associated leveraged financial products.

- DCP-0006 Social Media Governance, [announced](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1245399765489254400?s=20) Apr 1, is in doubt with an unexpectedly large proportion of respondents (66%) to the twitter poll voting to give twitter the greatest weighting - this raises serious questions about the sampling methodology.

  

## Markets

In March DCR was trading between USD 8.68-19.78 / BTC 0.0017-0.0021. The average daily rate was $13.40.

{markets overview: USD and BTC prices, highs and lows, interesting events, interesting analysis}

On Mar 7 BTC/USD started its decline from $9,100 mark down to $7,800 on Mar 11. Following the global stock market crash and the wave of coronavirus panic on that week, BTC/USD tanked on Mar 12 with a bottom of ~$5,600. Most cryptoassets lost around 40% that day, demonstrating their persisting dependence on BTC and the mostly speculative price levels. This dump took DCR/USD with it down to $8.68. {update numbers}

## Relevant External

{governance, funding, chain forks, community forks}

Markets everywhere had a [very bad time](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-08/yen-slides-as-oil-price-war-adds-to-global-worries-markets-wrap) as the severity of the COVID-19 situation became clear and nations began to lock down. Cryptocurrency prices declined as much or more than most other assets, all Decred meetups and events are cancelled or moving online, and some contributors have more childcare to do than before, but those seem to the only changes that are directly relevant to Decred. Nevertheless, the situation obviously has an effect on all of us and the broader macroeconomic environment and outlook. Stay safe 

It was a challenging month for DeFi, as a sharp drop in the price of ETH strained the stability of the DAI stablecoin. When ETH price moves too much some DAI loans will be liquidated in auctions if their holders do not add more ETH to reach the required collateralization, but on this occasion the price appears to have moved too quickly for the liquidation auctions to keep up. This [article](https://medium.com/@whiterabbit_hq/black-thursday-for-makerdao-8-32-million-was-liquidated-for-0-dai-36b83cac56b6) explains how $8.32 million worth of DAI was liquidated for $0, as unforeseen conditions in the auction process (including ETH chain congestion) resulted in 36% of all liquidation auctions going to the highest bidder at $0.00. "The greatest Vault has lost ~35 000 ETH whereas the most successful liquidator has had a profit of 30 000 ETH". This left the Maker Foundation and community in a difficult [position](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-leader-makerdao-weighs-emergency-shutdown-following-eth-price-drop), considering changing the rules on the fly or triggering an emergency shutdown. The Foundation [decided](https://www.coindesk.com/makerdao-debts-grow-as-defi-leader-moves-to-stabilize-protocol) not to use its power to intervene directly by triggering a shutdown, and moved to introduce proposals that modified risk parameters and set up an auction of newly printed MKR tokens to pay the protocol debt and "refund CDPs that lost funds".

The Steem-Sun conflict began last month when the Steemit company (and its "ninja mined" Steem tokens) was acquired by Justin Sun - Steem (DPoS) witnesses adopted a hard fork to nullify those tokens, then Sun mobilized exchange support to oust the established witnesses and replace them with puppets that would not adopt the fork, preserving his STEEM tokens. In March the strategy of the Steem community changed, as an influential group decided to [migrate](https://www.coindesk.com/steem-will-hard-fork-in-just-hours-over-community-fears-of-justin-sun-power-grab) away from the Steem blockchain to a new one called Hive. Exchanges Binance and Huobi are said to be supportive of this move, in a remarkable turnaround from their actions last month where they voted with Sun. Prominent members of the Steem community thanked community members for withdrawing their STEEM from exchanges, to put pressure on exchanges to backtrack on supporting the Sun-powered witnesses. It seems the exchange operators were also misled about the significance of their votes in that context, believing that they were voting for a regular protocol upgrade.

Hive is the same as Steem in most regards, with 1 STEEM being exchangeable for 1 HIVE - the main difference is that Sun's Steemit STEEM tokens will not be redeemable on the HIVE chain, effectively cutting them out of the ecosystem. When this [story](https://www.coindesk.com/splinter-cryptocurrency-hive-outperforms-justin-suns-steem-after-one-week-trading) was written the price of HIVE was almost double that of STEEM, but as of Apr 4 the two tokens are trading for similar prices. This case should be of interest to those who say coin voting is plutocratic, as it shows what can happen when whales try to use their coins to impose their will on an unwilling community.

It has been a good month for people who like to buy, hold or sell cryptocurrency without being considered a criminal. The governments in [South Korea](https://thenews.asia/amendment-to-special-reporting-act-passes-cryptocurrency-trading-now-legal-in-south-korea/) and supreme court in [India](https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-legal-india-supreme-court-verdict-cryptocurrency/) making moves to nullify previously imposed restrictions on cryptocurrency trading.

Since Mar 18 Tether has issued over $400M USDT in batches of $60M and surpassed the [$6 billion](https://beincrypto.com/tether-usdt-quietly-surpasses-the-6-billion-mark/) mark. On Mar 25 USDT held on exchanges has set a new ATH of [$1.2 billion](https://twitter.com/glassnodealerts/status/1242849119456157699). { check numbers} The timing is interesting as it comes quickly after the market crash of Mar 12. Use USDT with caution, because even its co-founder believes ["it doesn't really matter"](https://beincrypto.com/tether-co-founder-it-doesnt-really-matter-if-usdt-backed-by-equal-amount-of-dollars/) if it's backed by an equal amount of dollars. { check the audio for exact quote }

U.S. government approved an exceptionally large [$2 trillion](https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/anatomy-2-trillion-covid-19-stimulus-bill) "stimulus" plan attributed to COVID-19. Discussion of the source of funds is still rare in the media. One politician [argued](https://twitter.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1243565651391897603) that the bill creates even more secrecy around the Fed that is already not auditable.

U.S. Fed made multiple unprecedented moves attributed to COVID-19, succinctly  [summarized](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-25/fed-unbound-all-the-u-s-central-bank-s-corona-related-moves) by Bloomberg. For those still following the ["repo" numbers](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/ny-fed-conduct-1-trillion-repo-over-two-days-stabilize-treasury-financing-market), the amount of overnight loans (started as a "temporary" measure in Sep 2019) has reached $1T, while the amount of longer-term loans is projected to reach $4T. Most of that means creating money out of thin air without any labor, and then loaning out that money to people and businesses who will need to work to pay it back. Among the measures are swap lines built to "pump USD out across the world to ease access to the world's most important currency".

President of one of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks openly admitted in an [interview](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/kashkari-says-fed-has-infinite-amount-cash-we-create-it-electronically) that "there's an infinite amount of cash at the Federal Reserve".

ECB [announced](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html) a EUR 750 billion "Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme" and [noted](https://twitter.com/Lagarde/status/1240414918966480896) "There are no limits to our commitment to the euro. We are determined to use the full potential of our tools, within our mandate". The bank is ready to further increase the size of asset purchase programmes and revise any self-imposed limits.



## Happy Birthday DJ

24th issue marks the second anniversary of Decred Journal.

Retrospective and a bit of trivia from @bee:

- The DJ team has grown from 2 to ~5 stable contributors, a half dozen translators, and 1-2 dozens people reviewing and sharing feedback.
- The byte size of an issue has grown from 20 KB to ~50 KB. The biggest issue was [64.5 K](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/201908.html).
- Our production process has evolved significantly and is now extensively [documented](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/guidelines.md).
- You may have noticed that [Decred](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/201805.html) [Cake](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/202002.html) has a special meaning for me.
- Among dozens of titles considered were "Monthly Stakeholder Entertainment Session" and "Deep in Decred". The latter was rejected as having too strong connotations with adult content.
- { maybe post that Mar 2018 draft for fun }
- In March 2019 I got somewhat exhausted and [announced](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/201903.html#psa-decred-journal-takes-a-break) that the production of future issues is uncertain. Luckily, a few more people have [stepped in](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/issues/65) and we continued.
- Problem of the first year: at the start of every issue I worried that it wouldn't get enough content. I was wrong every single time. Problem of the second year: at the end of every issue I worried that we wouldn't cover everything we'd like to or grow it too big. And it was often the case! There's too much going on in Decred and in the crypto space.
- I couldn't imagine what the [index](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) of all issues and translations would look like in 2 years!
- After pioneering the use of Git and GitHub for DJ I began to annoy pretty much everyone in the community to do the same for other documents. I believe that knowledge preservation is [important](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/guidelines.md#why-git) and will keep annoying you guys. Thank you for your patience.
- About 6 months after starting DJ I began to worry about decreasing Reddit upvotes. I talked to people and learned two things. First is that people who've been here for years told me it is common: humans get less sensitive to any stimulus over time, even high quality one. Second is that I don't know these people who leave likes. But people I do know, talk to every day, people with most intelligence and wisdom, people I care about most and who are the reason why I'm still here, keep telling me I'm doing a good job. And they keep doing their job for years. So I asked myself, why do I care about these unknown people more than I care what the best people around me think? It doesn't make sense! So I stopped worrying about that. (No offense to any DJ readers!)
- We received a lot of positive [feedback](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/testimonials.html) over these two years. We don't write DJ for praise, but kind words let us know that we're still on the right track. Thank you all!
