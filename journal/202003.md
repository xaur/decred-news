## Markets

In March DCR was trading between USD {n.nn}-{n.nn} / BTC {}-{}. The average daily rate was ${n.nn}.

{markets overview: USD and BTC prices, highs and lows, interesting events, interesting analysis}

On Mar 7 BTC/USD started its decline from $9,100 mark down to $7,800 on Mar 11. Following the global stock market crash and the wave of coronavirus panic on that week, BTC/USD tanked on Mar 12 with a bottom of ~$5,600. Most cryptoassets lost around 30% that day, demonstrating their persisting dependence on BTC and the mostly speculative price levels. This dump took DCR/USD with it down to $10.8. {update numbers}

U.S. government approved an exceptionally large [$2 trillion](https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/anatomy-2-trillion-covid-19-stimulus-bill) "stimulus" plan attributed to COVID-19. Discussion of the source of funds is still rare in the media. One polititian [argued](https://twitter.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1243565651391897603) that the bill creates even more secrecy around the Fed that is already not auditable.

U.S. Fed made multiple unprecedented moves attributed to COVID-19, succinctly  [summarized](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-25/fed-unbound-all-the-u-s-central-bank-s-corona-related-moves) by Bloomberg. For those still following the ["repo" numbers](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/ny-fed-conduct-1-trillion-repo-over-two-days-stabilize-treasury-financing-market), the amount of overnight loans (started as a "temporary" measure in Sep 2019) has reached $1T, while the amount of longer-term loans is projected to reach $4T. Most of that means creating money out of thin air without any labor, and then loaning out that money to people and businesses who will need to work to pay it back. Among the measures are swap lines built to "pump USD out across the world to ease access to the world's most important currency".

President of one of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks openly admitted in an [interview](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/kashkari-says-fed-has-infinite-amount-cash-we-create-it-electronically) that "there's an infinite amount of cash at the Federal Reserve".

ECB [announced](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html) a EUR 750 billion "Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme" and [noted](https://twitter.com/Lagarde/status/1240414918966480896) "There are no limits to our commitment to the euro. We are determined to use the full potential of our tools, within our mandate". The bank is ready to further increase the size of asset purchase programmes and revise any self-imposed limits.
