## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

Merged in master and backported to v1.6 release:

- corrected [fee calculations](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2530) to fix some transactions being considered lower priority in some reorg scenarios
- whitelisted DCP-5 [violations](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2533). Due to a bug that has since been fixed, 5 blocks were accepted with an old block version 6 when the majority of the network had already upgraded to version 7. The blocks were otherwise valid and are now whitelisted to allow fully syncing the chain without checkpoints.

Merged in master:

- moved [context checks](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2481) from sanity/positional functions to proper locations to restore the intended restrictions that were in place before the decentralized treasury work. These will be necessary to decouple block processing order from download order.
- changed main chain [block cache](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2488) semantics to be less dependent on the order the block data is seen
- extracted block manager into its own [`netsync`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2500) package to improve its testability and more cleanly split syncing with the network from consensus validation
- several other changes towards [multi-peer](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1145) block downloading
- added mining [test harness](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2480) that will make it easier to add test coverage and help to optimize block template generation code
- changed RPC server [authentication](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2486) to use HMAC-SHA256 with random key unique to each startup to harden against certain classes of memory dumping attacks
- more [rpcserver](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2069) test coverage
- multiple places updated to follow error handling [best practices](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2181)
- smaller code and test updates across the board

A total of 51 PRs and 92 commits from 6 contributors were [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2020-12-01..2020-12-31+sort%3Aupdated-asc), adding 10K and deleting 8K lines of code.

In other news, there have been commits on Dec 30 and Jan 1 but thankfully none on Dec 31!

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

- [random coin](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1937) selection for paying VSP fees (this also enables to reattempt and complete some VSP ticket purchases that were always failing before)
- fixed [unpublished](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1941) outputs being used for funding other transactions (occurred with VSP fees that stay in unpublished state until the ticket is submitted with the VSP)
- code refactoring

In progress:

- ability to [import](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1945) voting accounts derived from a different seed { for Trezor staking support I guess? }

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

- added button to mix [all funds](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3041) to the Privacy page

- updated translations (Arabic, Chinese, German, Japanese, Italian, Polish, Spanish)
- ~23 fixes and UI tweaks

{ will there be an RC5? }

**[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia)**

- removed [CSRF](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1356) on public routes to prevent the possibility to link trickled votes by the CSRF token. The privacy impact was minimal: linking CSRF tokens to trickled votes would require writing additional code, since it is not done automatically by the CSRF library used.
- new `politeiavoter` command to [verify](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1355) votes
- end-to-end UI tests for proposal [editing](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2227)
- removed annoying Logout modal and moved the rarely used "Logout permanently" function to Account tab
- UX improvements for CMS invoice handling and review
- Politeia and CMS bug fixes

tlog integration update from @lukebp:

> The ability to retrieve the full timestamp for any piece of user submitted data has been added. Frontend work for this is still ongoing. The backend tlog branch is now feature complete and we'll be starting the code review process.

**[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd)**

- reject reused or old [timestamps](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/215)
- more test coverage for database code
- smaller fixes and preparations for v1.0 release

**[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool)**

- [single miner](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/274) endpoint { what does this do? }
- save [client info](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/293) in the database and make it available on any dcrpool instance
- support for NiceHash pool [validator](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/294) (allows it to connect to dcrpool and query basic stats) { is this description correct? }

**[dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex)**

- new [max order](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/842) button that populates quantity fields with the maximum amount possible based on market, market side and wallet balance
- public [market data](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/796) API endpoints via HTTP and WebSockets
- show [account ID](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/825) for each DEX server
- favor [confirmed](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/865) outputs for funding BTC orders
- [resume](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/856) swapper from the database (better than the previous approach and less code)
- allow apps to listen on [IPv6](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/899) addresses
- improve colors to differentiate between buy and sell orders
- many bug fixes and dependency upgrades

A total of 28 PRs from 7 contributors were [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2020-12-01..2020-12-31+sort%3Aupdated-asc), adding 8K and deleting 5K lines of code.

Note that features added to dcrlibwallet become available for dcrandroid, dcrios and godcr (assuming they add UI for it).

**[dcrios](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrios)**

- [automated](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrios/pull/707) UI tests for some scenarios using XCUI

## Governance

In December the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 12,099 DCR and spent 7,466 DCR. Using December's daily average DCR/USD rate of $31.07, this is $376K received and $232K spent. At Octobers's average daily rate of $18.19, the USD figure billed for past work is $136K. As of Jan 5, Treasury balance is 641,260 DCR (30.2 million USD at $47.16).

Two proposals were submitted and voted on in December:

- The third [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/350f64b) from the Decred ES team requested $14,800 to fund six months work, scaled down from an initial ask of $42,000, with items relating to Talent Land Blockchain Challenge and Codigo Decred being cut. This proposal was rejected with 54.5% Yes votes, having failed to meet the 60% threshold - turnout was 37%.
- The Decred Hackathons and LATAM Initial Chapter [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5ce1636) submitted after the hackathons element of the LATAM marketing proposal was cut, the people behind it are members of the ES team. The proposal requested a max budget of $17,000 to create materials for hackathons and run two hackathons, with $3,500 of the budget reserved for prizes. The proposal was rejected with 50.2% yes votes and turnout of 36%.

While December was a quiet month for proposals, there are already two new ones in January, for renewed funding of [DCRDEX](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d462ac3) and [Decred in Depth](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/391108e) (under new management).

Politeia Digest took a break in December but will be back soon.

## Network

Hashrate: December's [hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=ki3ivfpm-kjej4ggy&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~292 Ph/s and closed ~340 Ph/s, bottoming at 240 Ph/s and peaking at 452 Ph/s throughout the month. Pool hashrate [distribution](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) as of Jan 1: UUPool 42%, Poolin 35%, easy2mine 12%, F2Pool 3.9%, Antpool 2.7%, Huobipool 2.6%, BTC.com 1.3%, Luxor 1.2%, CoinMine 0.02%.

Staking: [30-day average](https://dcrstats.com/) ticket price was 163.9 DCR (+5.2). The [price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=ki3ivfpm-kjej4ggy&axis=time&visibility=true-false&mode=stepped) varied between 150.6-190.99 DCR. [Locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=ki3ivfpm-kjej4ggy&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was 6.42-6.68 million DCR, which corresponded to 52.01-54.20% of the available supply [participating](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=ki3ivfpm-kjej4ggy&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in PoS.

Another month, another high broken. Ticket price peaked at 190.9 DCR and stake participation at 54.2%.

Nodes: Throughout [December](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=1606780800000&to=1609459200000) there was an average of 87 public listening nodes and 200 total nodes per dcr.farm. Average version distribution for December: 27% dcrd v1.5.2, 21% dcrd v1.6 dev and RC builds, 16% dcrd v1.5.1, 5% dcrd v1.7 dev builds, 5% dcrd v1.5.0, 3% dcrd v1.5 dev and RC builds, 0.7% dcrd v1.4, 10% dcrwallet v1.5.1, 1.3% dcrwallet v1.6 dev and RC builds, 1% dcrwallet v1.5, 0.7% dcrwallet v1.4, 9% others.

@Checkmate reports via [Our Network](https://ournetwork.substack.com/p/our-network-issue-50-part-2) newsletter that a number of on-chain metrics are hitting all time highs.

@PermabullNino reports a ~500K DCR [increase](https://twitter.com/PermabullNino/status/1338497116864438273) in ticket pool balance over the 28-day period.

Mainnet Lightning Network is slowly growing. Throughout 2020 there was an average of 15 nodes, 30 channels and 6 DCR capacity. As of Jan 8 there are 24 nodes, 42 channels and a total capacity of 8.7 DCR according to @jholdstock's [LN map](https://ln-map.jamieholdstock.com/).

## Integrations

[Ultravsp](https://ultravsp.uk/) (formerly Ultrapool) and [Ubiq](https://dcrvsp.ubiqsmart.com/) VSPs have both launched mainnet instances of the new [vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) voting software. Their [dcrstakepool](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool) servers will continue running at [legacy.ultravsp.uk](https://legacy.ultravsp.uk/) and [dcr.ubiqsmart.com](https://dcr.ubiqsmart.com/), respectively.

Note that Ultravsp had to migrate from ultrapool.eu to a UK domain [ultravsp.uk](https://ultravsp.uk/) due to the Brexit [domain mess](https://www.theregister.com/2021/01/05/brexit_81000_eu_domains/), and there will be no automatic redirection due to prohibitive complexity of setting it up. VSP users who recently had active tickets have been notified via email.

Bittrex [added](https://twitter.com/BittrexExchange/status/1341801493964308482) an [instant exchange](https://bittrex.com/instant) feature that allows to quickly buy assets with a debit card or exchange's fiat balance. DCR was reported to work.

[MXC Exchange](https://www.mxc.com/) [added](https://twitter.com/MXC_Exchange/status/1334707659900035075) 5x leverage margin trading DCR/USDT pair in addition to regular DCR/USDT pair they listed in 2019.

Turkish exchange [Bitexen](https://www.bitexen.com/) [announced](https://twitter.com/bitexencom/status/1339858540614266880) the listing of DCR among 11 other [assets](https://destek.bitexen.com/portal/tr/kb/articles/bitexen-11-adet-yeni-coin).

Malta-based instant exchange aggregator [Swapzone](https://swapzone.io/) has DCR support since [May](https://twiter.com/swapzoneio/status/1263049492963774465) or earlier but in December it got on our radar and was [added](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/937) to decred.org [exchanges](https://decred.org/exchanges/) page.

## Markets

In December DCR was trading between USD 24.01-41.59 / BTC 0.0012-0.002. The average daily rate was $31.07.

With the massive bitcoin runup, Decred has also been raising in USD without losing much ground in BTC value.

During the 48 days of DCRDEX operation it has [traded](https://ournetwork.substack.com/p/our-network-issue-50-part-2) ~600K DCR, which is 30% of Binance volume over the same period. Unlike any centralized exchange though, this volume is much more reliable and harder to cheat.

@Checkmate [announced](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1338418991212052485) the launch of [checkonchain.com](https://checkonchain.com/) with many, many charts:

> Now this is something I have been working on for a very long time. If you want serious edge in this market, pay attention to the beating heart of the chain. A full blown masterclass to learn how to properly apply each metric is coming in hot soon after.

The Cover Protocol, which "allows DeFi users to be protected against smart contract risk", was [hacked](https://www.coindesk.com/cover-protocol-plans-new-token-after-attack) and the attacker minted 40 quintillion COVER tokens, liquidating these for $4 million, but later returning the funds to the smart contract. The team are now looking at creating a new version of the COVER token with a snapshot to refund COVER holders, because otherwise those extra 40 quintillion tokens would mess up the tokenomics.

Nexus Mutual's CEO was hacked for $.8.3 million when an attacker tricked him into signing a transaction that sent all his NXM to the attacker's wallet. The attacker [laundered](https://coingeek.com/nexus-mutual-attacker-cashes-out-3-million/) $2.7 million to BTC, and this sent the NXM price lower, they then sent a message on the Ethereum blockchain offering to return the rest (so NXM could avoid further pain) for a [ransom](https://coingeek.com/nexus-mutual-attacker-wants-3-million-in-ransom-money/) of $2.8 million in ETH. 

December's top DeFi rug pull was [Compounder finance](https://www.coindesk.com/compounder-developers-implicated-alleged-smart-contract-rug-pull), whose devs absconded with $10.8 million of investor funds after utilizing a hidden backdoor in the contracts.

December's top flash loan attack victim was [Warp Finance](https://decrypt.co/52125/warp-finance-recovers-5-8-million-days-after-hack), with the exploit weighing in at $7.7 million, but $5.85 million is being returned to holders. This is arguably December's top DeFi hack refund too, but COVER is a contender for that title because although the dollar amount being returned was smaller, it represented a ridiculous proportion of the COVER supply.

Gitcoin ended a [strong 2020](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-year-in-review/) with its 8th round of Ethereum funding seeing a matching pool of $450K, and also the first round of non-Ethereum funding for Zcash projects was [completed](https://electriccoin.co/blog/zcash-gitcoin-grants-round-1-retrospective/), dispensing a $25K matching pool from Zcash Foundation but attracting just 156 donations totalling $2,137.

A bill was [introduced](https://www.coindesk.com/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-that-would-require-stablecoin-issuers-to-obtain-bank-charters) in US Congress that would require stablecoin issuers to obtain bank charters, requiring approval from the Federal Reserve and various other bodies before circulating any coins.

The front line in crypto regulations then [shifted](https://www.coindesk.com/self-hosted-bitcoin-wallets-become-front-line-in-fight-over-crypto-regulations) to "self-hosted wallets" (i.e. any self-custodied crypto) and the degree of due diligence that exchanges are required to carry out on transactions involving these questionable entities.

In an effort to shake off regulators, Facebook's Libra [rebranded](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2020/12/02/facebooks-libra-renamed-to-diem-prior-to-stablecoin-launch) to Diem and dropped the aspiration of being backed by a basket of currencies in favor of straight USD backing.

Ledger's leak of customer data, originally reported in July, has now been [dumped](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ledger-data-leak-a-simple-mistake-exposed-270k-crypto-wallet-buyers) publicly. In the original announcement Ledger stated that more detailed information such as physical address had been accessed for 9.5K customers, but it seems [now](https://www.ledger.com/message-ledgers-ceo-data-leak/) that this information was harvested for 272K customers.
