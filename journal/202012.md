## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{ hint: add below overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warrants a paragraph, drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans }

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

Merged in master and backported to v1.6 release:

- corrected [fee calculations](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2530) to fix some transactions being considered lower priority in some reorg scenarios
- whitelisted DCP-5 [violations](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2533). 5 blocks were accepted with an old block version 6 when the majority of the network had already upgraded to version 7. The bug has since been fixed. The blocks were otherwise valid and are now whitelisted to allow fully syncing the chain without checkpoints. { is this wording good enough? is no-checkpoint sync the primary reason for whitelisting? how "bad" was the bug and which PR fixed it? }
- { does the extra commit to use [blockchain v3.0.3](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2539) add anything to v1.6 on top of the above two changes? if not, why this PR is necessary when previous commits have already ported the fixes? (sorry not well versed with Go module system) }

Merged in master:

- moved [context checks](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2481) from sanity/positional functions to proper locations to restore the intended restrictions that were in place before the decentralized treasury work. These will be necessary to decouple block processing order from download order.
- changed main chain [block cache](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2488) semantics to be less dependent on the order the block data is seen
- extracted block manager into its own [`netsync`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2500) package to improve its testability and more cleanly split syncing with the network from consensus validation
- several other changes towards [multi-peer](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1145) block downloading
- added mining [test harness](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2480) that will simplify adding more test coverage and optimizing template generation code
- changed RPC server [authentication](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2486) to use HMAC-SHA256 with random key unique to each startup to harden against certain classes of memory dumping attacks
- more [rpcserver](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2069) test coverage
- multiple places updated to follow error handling [best practices](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2181)
- smaller code and test updates across the board

A total of 51 PRs and 92 commits from 6 contributors were [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2020-12-01..2020-12-31+sort%3Aupdated-asc), adding 10K and deleting 8K lines of code.

In other news, there have been commits on Dec 30 and Jan 1 but thankfully none on Dec 31!

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

- [random coin](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1937) selection for paying VSP fees (this also enables to reattempt and complete some VSP ticket purchases that were always failing before)
- fixed [unpublished](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1941) outputs being used for funding other transactions (occurred with VSP fees that stay in unpublished state until the ticket is submitted with the VSP)
- code refactoring

In progress:

- ability to [import](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1945) voting accounts derived from a different seed { for Trezor staking support I guess? }

[Locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=t1-t2&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was {n.dd}-{n.dd} million DCR, which corresponded to {n.d}-{n.d}% of the available supply [participating](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=t1-t2&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in PoS.
