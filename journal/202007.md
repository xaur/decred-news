## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

- added more [test coverage](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2069) for the `rpcserver` package
- [exported](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2243) several `txscript` functions that are independently useful to make the Treasury PR a bit smaller
- [exported](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2240) various consensus functions and types as a step to remove all non-consensus code out of the `txscript` package
- field normalization code [hardened](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2258) against the possibility of non-constant time operations due to branch prediction (primarily based on a [pull request](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/pull/1084) to btcd from 2017). The PR demonstrates a way of detecting non-constant time behavior by _simply_ looking at the assembly output.
- added handling of [`notfound`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2253) peer message (increase peer's ban score and stop requesting blocks and transactions that were not found by it) { did I read it right? }
- mining code [moved](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1965) into `mining` package
- [`mempool`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2274), [`mining`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2275) and [`fees`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2287) converted from exported modules to internal packages to reduce the maintenance burden. This is part of the overall effort to reduce the total number of modules and eventually get to the point that it will be possible to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for the root module.
- memory usage optimizations in [stake](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2294) node pruning, txscript [stack](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2298), trace [logging](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2301), and [chain tip](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2302) tracking code
- `rpcserver` code [moved](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2288) from the main module to a standalone internal package
- `cpuminer` [refactored](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2276) into its own package to improve testability and facilitate reuse
- `cpuminer` [reworked](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2277) to use the background block template generator to simplify testing with simulation test networks

Commenting on the status of optimizations:

> Flame graph for CPU usage shows pretty clearly that things are being dominated by IO now, so the biggest speedups left will definitely come from that front. ~10% GC, <1% validation, ~3.5% peer I/O, ~55% disk I/O, ~3% profiling cost, ~27% idle, and the rest in minor bits and bobs. ([@davecgh](https://matrix.to/#/!zefvTnlxYHPKvJMThI:decred.org/$U9ybkey7ppiqGR_K_BagIHwcoyNGTS-H91hEaXzghmI))

{ maybe add summary of module movements }

{ maybe add code/contributor stats }

In progress:

- decentralized Treasury [pull request](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2170) has more than 300 comments now

{ Schnorr sounds exciting, any extra info is welcome! (why, how) }

{ any other comments on Treasury are welcome too ofc }

If you have some idle hardware, you can help by [fuzz testing](https://github.com/degeri/dcrd-continuous-fuzz) dcrd.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

- added optional [gaplimit](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1761) parameter to the `discoverusage` command
- added optional [account](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1767) parameter to the `listunspent` command

- added CoinJoin [params](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1780) to the `PurchaseTicketRequest` call
- implemented [`getpeerinfo`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1797) command in SPV mode
- added new command to change wallet's public [passphrase](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1510)
- bug fixes

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton):

- backup and restore of the [SCB file](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2535) generated by dcrlnd (see explanation in the [docs](https://docs.decred.org/lightning-network/backups/))
- display of basic [LN info](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2575)
- added back proper [decoding](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2523) of staking transactions (needed for signing messages for the VSP)
- continued [upgrading](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pulls?q=functional+is%3Apr+merged%3A2020-07-01..2020-07-31+sort%3Aupdated-asc) the codebase to modern React using functional components and CSS modules
- initial PoC support of the new [vspd](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2516) staking system
- support for [short](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2602) proposal URLs
- don't require passphrase when importing [redeem](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2616) scripts
- bug fixes

{ what is the overall status of the transition to functional components, custom hooks and CSS modules? and are any practical benefits showing up already? }

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia):

- command-line [utility](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1240) to test the RFP process
- improved test coverage
- bug fixes

Multiple new [features](https://twitter.com/lukebp_/status/1285955294703411201) have been deployed to the [proposals.decred.org](https://proposals.decred.org/) site: RFP process, flat display of comments (helps to quickly spot new comments without hunting them down in the thread), dark mode, short proposal URLs, and a switch to restrict posting comments once a day instead of once an hour (workaround for a limitation that will be fixed with the migration to the tlog backend).

CMS:

- admin [searching](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2033) contractors by domain or type
- display proposal [names](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2041) instead of tokens in invoice line items
- assigning proposal [ownership](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2055) (GUI)
- admin review of proposal [spending](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2032) summary and details
- new tab for proposal [owners](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2046) to review billing details
- [highlighting](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2057) for illegal characters in invoice line items

[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd):

- voting wallet [consistency](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/86) checks (the [last](https://twitter.com/JamieHoldstock/status/1288030715486056448) major change necessary for the release)
- admin table showing the [status](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/149) of each voting wallet
- API versioning and a few bug fixes

{ anything to add? }

[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd):

- updated to use latest [dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/90) and [dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/105)
- new [chainscan](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/83) package that uses committed filters to detect transactions relevant for the LN node more efficiently and can also operate in SPV mode
- [implementations](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/92) for chainntnfs package and a [driver](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/93) for the chainview package that use embedded and remote dcrwallet as a source of chain events. This allows to further decouple dcrlnd from an underlying dcrd, which is a requirement for having a dcrlnd instance running in SPV mode.
- [switched](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/94) the main dcrlnd package to use the new wallet-backed drivers so that chain IO operations are now fully performed by the underlying dcrwallet instance and dcrlnd no longer requires a connection to a running dcrd to perform its job
- enable and test [SPV mode](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/95) for remote wallets (see [March issue](202003.md#development) for more background)
- [ported](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/99) upstream lnd changes between v0.9.0-beta and 0.10.0-beta - 139 upstream PRs (plus a few non-PR'd commits) were considered for inclusion

[dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex):

- { unbookHook for swapper: please translate to English or drop https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/475 }
- [smart fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/505): orders reserve enough for a "max fee rate" in case BTC fees are high when the order is filled, but the optimal network fee at match time is used for the swap contract transaction
- server [ban](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/469) and [unban](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/479) endpoints
- infrastructure for [upgrading](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/448) client database
- added [nomatch](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/535) notification { how does it work? notable for end users? }
- multiple bug fixes, testing improvements, and UI tweaks

- updated French translation
- bug fixes
- fetching Politeia [proposals](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrlibwallet/pull/153) added to dcrlibwallet base library

## Governance

In July the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 13,050 DCR and spent 16,073 DCR. Using July's daily average DCR/USD rate of $15.13, this is $197K received and $243K spent. At June's average daily rate of $16.05, the USD figure billed for work completed in that month is $258K. As of Aug 1, Treasury balance is 630,766 DCR (10.7 million USD at $16.92).

There were 7 proposals submitted in July:

* The proposal from @Lindsey McConaghey for continuation of PR services at $3,500/month for one year was approved with 90% support (25% turnout), up on the first proposal's 72% approval.
* [Proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/dedf452074752d7e29304a0566643feb26d1d130596e04c613e15de113ac2d08) to spend $15,000 creating augmented reality posters.
* [Proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/32cba00b8bb0f41689ca8216e2e14a0e3d91a724c83369b3fcda02490dc119f4) to cover moderation of Matrix, Discord, Telegram and Politeia, max $9,000 expected $4,800 for 6 months. This work is already being done and paid for, the proposal is to formalize this and put a limit on how much can be billed for it.
* [Proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2dcbc3e14c06c6e84449f5e2756b944d5ed23be41c23a9f5225f3eef424ce0ae) to offer DCR as a payment option on two travel booking websites ($30k), plus some promotional activities ($21.5k). 
* [Proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/3372cfce1218ba81d9c8ca0535cd9dd590f60c92adc068c0089218ae7e3e99e1) to spend $10k on a range of marketing activities (including paid retweets/endorsements and advertisements).
* [Proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4f81031) to create 10 social media memes for 10 DCR/meme.
* [Proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/7a67ed5) to host a series of poker games with DCR prizes (300 DCR/month).

Two of these proposals have an issue with DCR-denominated budgets, which keeps cropping up fairly regularly with new proposals.

- Binance added both [DCR/BUSD](https://www.binance.com/en/support/articles/fee761e58d684bc3a1c7fc11660ab596) and [DCR/USDT](https://www.binance.com/en/support/articles/043fc71cdcce4fcfbdae133d8d0f35aa) pairs within weeks of each other.

- There have been some community rumblings that [Binance](https://matrix.to/#/!aNnAOHkWUdNcEXRGjJ:decred.org/$sT0_H8a5bHf8iZFUjrLGlV-tgvJVgwmrH9wvoNTkhKw) is about to launch a staking service for DCR. On July 31 Binance [announced](https://www.binance.com/en/support/articles/f73f03d86f1a421fb9afce1221baff2e) that they will be adding "cold staking" although no coins have been annouced yet.

- Binance is about to launch a staking service similar to Kucoin for their Decred users. https://matrix.to/#/!aNnAOHkWUdNcEXRGjJ:decred.org/$sT0_H8a5bHf8iZFUjrLGlV-tgvJVgwmrH9wvoNTkhKw on the rumour side ? Added a releated news (check above)

The subject of marketing saw considerable discussion on reddit and Matrix. and specifically what role the Treasury of a decentralized project like Decred should play in this.

@checkmate has been stirring the pot of grassroots outreach and other ideas on reddit, with regular and irregular posts provoking discussion that has also spilled over into some other marketing-related discussion posts. This month's outreach braindroplets:

* @mrbulb posted a Workshop Wednesday, inviting people to explore the 4 key stages of narrative development with him.
* Skepticism Sunday 5 July considered hardware wallets and staking, @jy-p [knows](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hluve9/decred_skepticism_sunday_05_july_2020/fx38dq3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) a new dev who is into this kind of thing. This edition also featured an epic [ragequit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hluve9/decred_skepticism_sunday_05_july_2020/fx2xh21) from an airdrop participant who bounced between DCR and XMR over the years, started staking in 2019 but is now done. Comes with: [itemized](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hluve9/decred_skepticism_sunday_05_july_2020/fx3f3wo) [debunking](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hluve9/decred_skepticism_sunday_05_july_2020/fx3fcd6) by @bee.
* FTF Jul 10 had [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/homdwc/forward_thinking_friday_10_july_2020/) about bringing dcr data to life for more people and showing off Decred's interesting and immaculately presented chain, plus rappers, graffiti and some skepticism that was shared on the wrong day.
* FTF Jul 17 on the subject of [differentiators](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/ht4r8a/forward_thinking_friday_differentiators_17_july/), looking at the different ways in which Decred stands out.
* @Noah shared a braindroplet about a Dapp for transparent governance with Politeia.
* FTF Jul 24 - Content [amplification](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hxblmd/forward_thinking_friday_content_amplification_24/) - cyclical patterns and getting the right messages to the right people.
* Juiced from Sunday's (lack of) [skepticism](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hy4x66/decred_skepticism_sunday_26_july_2020/), on Monday July 27 @checkmate dropped part 2 of the Grassroots Marketing Discussion -  [The Hardest Part](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hyrq5w/grassroots_marketing_discussion_round_2_the/). This post set out 3 observations (#1 marketing budgets to date have not performed well, #2 absence of structure and leaders, #3 Treasury creates perverse incentives in marketing). These have struck a chord with many community members (41 comments so far), and even brought Dustorf [back](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hyrq5w/grassroots_marketing_discussion_round_2_the/fzjjg0s) into the mix to share his perspective, and led to Praxis to [reveal](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hyrq5w/grassroots_marketing_discussion_round_2_the/fzffwfy) his new identity.
