## { Some Announcement }

{ _Add individual sections for high-impact announcements, such as consensus votes, software releases, milestones, major bugs, etc._ }


## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover its most notable dev work._
- _For each project, the order of reporting is "most released first": changes released to end users, merged to master, in progress (work started), discussions and future plans._
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

}


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commits/master }

- Always serve known filters when peers ask for it with [`getcfilterv2`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3035) request. Previously, a node would not serve the filters until its chain was fully synced with the network. This limitation was inherited from the old bloom filters logic, where it helped to avoid performance drops, especially during the initial chain sync. The downside is that the node could appear to be unresponsive or stalled in a variety of production and testing scenarios. The bloom filters have been replaced by version 2 filters and they are relatively cheap to serve now, so the node can always respond to `getcfilterv2` requests, even before the chain is fully synced.
- Removed [build flags](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3036) for Go versions prior to 1.17 now that the minimum supported version is Go 1.18.
- Updated JSON-RPC API [documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3032) for methods used for discovering transactions matching certain criteria: `loadtxfilter`, `notifynewtransactions`, and `rescan`. Information for removed API methods and notification has been removed { 3033 3034 }.
- Smaller changes and cleanup { 3037 3038 3040 3041 }

}

[v0.5.8 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.5.8):

- Added [Core API options](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1568) to skip time consuming operations on startup and shutdown. `NoAutoWalletLock` disables wallet locking on shutdown, which is useful for avoiding a potentially [very long](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1568#discussion_r998877146) unlock operation. `NoAutoDBBackup` disables automatic database backups on shutdown. `UnlockCoinsOnLogin` instructs the wallet to unlock any coins (outputs) locked individually on login or wallet creation, this automates the manual recovery from multiple [issues](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1568#discussion_r998880897) caused by dropped connections and crashes during order placement. These options can also be set using the new switches for the `dexc` command-line app, but they are really intended for people writing their own Go code to control the DEX client via the `Core` API.
- Fixed handling of failed [fiat rates requests](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/2ae50bb7617706c62b86e4b16b684744c995c818) to external services, and adjusted their frequency to avoid hitting rate limits.

Ethereum:

- Added client and server support for swaps with [testnet USDC](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1733). One review comment reminds to treat [floating point math](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1733#issuecomment-1303491236) with great care. { dig 1733 for more notes }
- Added ability for DEX client and server to connect over [authenticated WebSocket](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1963) to a Geth full node. This allows to run Geth on a separate machine.

Fidelity bonds (client):

- Third batch of [fidelity bonds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1820) implementation was merged, building on the lower-level API and server code added in October and November. This batch adds internal client code to create, store, post, confirm, and refund the bonds, as well as `dexc` app command for posting bond from the command line. Bonds implementaion was split into phases to make review feasible and progress in parallel with multiple other developments. Up next is account tier maintenance, bond renewal, settings, and UI components.
- Documented bonds in the [spec](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1994).
- For a recap, time-locked [fidelity bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_bond) will replace the current registration fee system. Users will lock coins in bonds and gain permissions to trade, as long as their bond tier is high enough (possibly compensating for poor trading behavior like cancelling orders too much). When trading is no longer needed the bond can be redeemed to get the coins back. Bonds system is a prerequisite for building a [server mesh](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1765).

Other client changes:

- Refactored [login sequence](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1903) to better handle multiple login attempts and avoid repeating intialization steps. Added a warning prompting to unlock the wallets ASAP to process active trades.
- Refactored [fee estimation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1967) common for Bitcoin-like assets and added external fee estimator for DOGE. External fee estimation is useful as a fallback for SPV (light) wallets and also RPC (full) wallets that have been started recently and their fee estimation has not calibrated yet.
- Added [default values](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1981) for wallets created over RPC. This is to assist testing on simnet.
- Moved more strings [translation files](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1980).
- Database [compaction](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1987) tuned to more aggressively free up space and report the savings more accurately.
- Added more detailed [progress reporting](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1997) during login.
- Added [Arabic translation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1898) and the required tweaks for showing right-to-left text.
- Fixed SPV wallet [log file deletion](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1946) during wallet recovery.
- Fixed [fiat value](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1983) on the Send form not including the transaction fee.
- Fixed crash with [empty config](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2000) value. { _may group, pretty sure it affected no releases_ }
- Fixed handling of the [Pre-size Funds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1988) option. This option creates an extra "split transaction" to prepare an exact amount of funds needed for the order, which avoids locking more funds than needed, but at the cost of additional fees to pay for the split. The fix avoids the pre-sizing transaction when there is no benefit. Also, the UX is made more consistent by always showing the option but explaining why it was turned off. Finally, another fix disables pre-sizing for [immediate market orders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/immediateorcancel.asp) since they must execute quickly.

Other:

- Updated [build config](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1979). { _minor_ }
- Smaller fixes { 1995 }

## Relevant External

{ _Hint: Find "epic win" stories besides just dramatic "epic fail" stories, in areas relevant to Decred. We can learn from both._ }

{ Story ideas I noted for November but did not have time for (bee): 

- Since we had a few bugs with Taproot, it means it is getting traction on Bitcoin. Explain what it is on a high level and where it is at.
- Big sell offs from BTC miners in Nov.
- Remind how much is owned by DCG (https://dcg.co/portfolio/) w.r.t contagion risks
- How regulators are abusing the FTX collapse to push for even more control while failing to quickly start due legal process against FTX.
- USDT circulation huge drop first time in history.
- CDBCs are the real danger while everybody is talking about FTX. Surprising coordination among many countries to launch in Spring 2023, including the digital dollar.
- https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/cbdc-is-a-tool-to-combat-bitcoin-says-bank-of-indonesia-exec-2694335
- U.S. savings reduced - if any notable unusual statistics in there.
- EU plans to ban privacy coins - I forgot the link.
- ConsenSys tracking MetaMask wallets.
- USDC tx may be more expensive to process due to resources on blacklists https://odysee.com/@DigitalCashNetwork:c/USDCYTS:f
- Crypto official means of payment in Brazil?
- Sia grants, ideally some Dec news https://medium.com/sia-tech/grants-program-update-november-2022-83dd4a7e266e
