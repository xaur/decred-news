## { Some Announcement }

{ _Add individual sections for high-impact announcements, such as consensus votes, software releases, milestones, major bugs, etc._ }


## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover its most notable dev work._
- _For each project, the order of reporting is "most released first": changes released to end users, merged to master, in progress (work started), discussions and future plans._
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

}


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commits/master }

- Always serve known filters when peers ask for it with [`getcfilterv2`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3035) request. Previously, a node would not serve the filters until its chain was fully synced with the network. This limitation was inherited from the old bloom filters logic, where it helped to avoid performance drops, especially during the initial chain sync. The downside is that the node could appear to be unresponsive or stalled in a variety of production and testing scenarios. The bloom filters have been replaced by version 2 filters and they are relatively cheap to serve now, so the node can always respond to `getcfilterv2` requests, even before the chain is fully synced.
- Updated JSON-RPC API [documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3032) for methods used for discovering transactions matching certain criteria: `loadtxfilter`, `notifynewtransactions`, and `rescan`. Information for removed API methods and notification has been [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3034) { also 3033 }.
- Smaller changes and cleanup { 3036 3037 3038 3040 3041 }


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commits/master }

- Added [`--cpuprofile`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2195) switch to capture CPU performance data and save it to a file.
- Added fetching of new [treasury spends in SPV mode](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2194). This will be used by Decrediton to enable TSpend voting in more scenarios.
- Modified [ticket purchasing](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1946) logic to support Trezor staking in upcoming changes to Decrediton. Staking DCR stored on a Trezor wallet is a much requested feature so here is some background. The combination of signing transactions with Trezor, Decred staking system, and the newer system of delegating ticket votes to Voting Service Providers (VSP), presents a number of challenges. One is that a VSP needs a private key of the voting address to vote with the ticket, but Trezor does not allow to export private keys directly. Another is that Decrediton needs to sign voting preferences for each VSP-managed ticket, but asking Trezor to sign every message is poor UX. To get around these, a piece of private data that can be obtained from Trezor will be used to derive keys for voting and signing vote preferences. This change wires some existing code together, and future changes will focus on ticket upkeep and re-paying failed VSP fees.
- Updated dependencies for supplementary command-line tools: movefunds, repaircfilters, and sweepaccount.


### dcrctl

_[dcrctl](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl) is a command-line client for dcrd and dcrwallet._

{ _Hint: dcrctl is pulling most of the code from dcrd and dcrwallet. Often there is not much to report and this section can be removed._ }

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/commits/master }

- {}


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/decrediton/commits/master }

- {}


### Politeia

_[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia) is Decred's proposal system. It is used to request funding from the Decred treasury._

### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software for running a Voting Service Provider. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/vspd/commits/master }

}

[v0.5.8 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.5.8):

- Added [Core API options](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1568) to skip time consuming operations on startup and shutdown. `NoAutoWalletLock` disables wallet locking on shutdown, which is useful for avoiding a potentially [very long](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1568#discussion_r998877146) unlock operation. `NoAutoDBBackup` disables automatic database backups on shutdown. `UnlockCoinsOnLogin` instructs the wallet to unlock any coins (outputs) locked individually on login or wallet creation, this automates the manual recovery from multiple [issues](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1568#discussion_r998880897) caused by dropped connections and crashes during order placement. These options can also be set using the new switches for the `dexc` command-line app, but they are really intended for people writing their own Go code to control the DEX client via the `Core` API.
- Fixed handling of failed [fiat rates requests](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/2ae50bb7617706c62b86e4b16b684744c995c818) to external services, and adjusted their frequency to avoid hitting rate limits.

Ethereum:

- Added client and server support for swaps with [testnet USDC](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1733). One review comment reminds to treat [floating point math](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1733#issuecomment-1303491236) with great care. { dig 1733 for more notes }
- Added ability for DEX client and server to connect over [authenticated WebSocket](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1963) to a Geth full node. This allows to run Geth on a separate machine.

Fidelity bonds (client):

- Third batch of [fidelity bonds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1820) implementation was merged, building on the lower-level API and server code added in October and November. This batch adds internal client code to create, store, post, confirm, and refund the bonds, as well as `dexc` app command for posting bond from the command line. Bonds implementaion was split into phases to make review feasible and progress in parallel with multiple other developments. Up next is account tier maintenance, bond renewal, settings, and UI components.
- Documented bonds in the [spec](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1994).
- For a recap, time-locked [fidelity bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_bond) will replace the current registration fee system. Users will lock coins in bonds and gain permissions to trade, as long as their bond tier is high enough (possibly compensating for poor trading behavior like cancelling orders too much). When trading is no longer needed the bond can be redeemed to get the coins back. Bonds system is a prerequisite for building a [server mesh](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1765).

Other client changes:

- Refactored [login sequence](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1903) to better handle multiple login attempts and avoid repeating intialization steps. Added a warning prompting to unlock the wallets ASAP to process active trades.
- Refactored [fee estimation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1967) common for Bitcoin-like assets and added external fee estimator for DOGE. External fee estimation is useful as a fallback for SPV (light) wallets and also RPC (full) wallets that have been started recently and their fee estimation has not calibrated yet.
- Added [default values](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1981) for wallets created over RPC. This is to assist testing on simnet.
- Moved more strings [translation files](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1980).
- Database [compaction](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1987) tuned to more aggressively free up space and report the savings more accurately.
- Added more detailed [progress reporting](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1997) during login.
- Added [Arabic translation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1898) and the required tweaks for showing right-to-left text.
- Fixed SPV wallet [log file deletion](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1946) during wallet recovery.
- Fixed [fiat value](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1983) on the Send form not including the transaction fee.
- Fixed crash with [empty config](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2000) value. { _may group, pretty sure it affected no releases_ }
- Fixed handling of the [Pre-size Funds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1988) option. This option creates an extra "split transaction" to prepare an exact amount of funds needed for the order, which avoids locking more funds than needed, but at the cost of additional fees to pay for the split. The fix avoids the pre-sizing transaction when there is no benefit. Also, the UX is made more consistent by always showing the option but explaining why it was turned off. Finally, another fix disables pre-sizing for [immediate market orders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/immediateorcancel.asp) since they must execute quickly.

Other:

- Updated [build config](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1979). { _minor_ }
- Smaller fixes { 1995 }

{ Story ideas I noted for November but did not have time for (bee): 

- Since we had a few bugs with Taproot, it means it is getting traction on Bitcoin. Explain what it is on a high level and where it is at.

In November, plans to outlaw privacy-enhancing crypto coins in the EU were [leaked](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/15/privacy-enhancing-crypto-coins-could-be-banned-under-leaked-eu-plans/). The plans were put forward by the Czech officials who are currently chairing talks. Crypto-asset service providers and other institutions would be banned from holding or touching privacy-enhancing cryptocurrency under the proposal.

ConsenSys faced a [backlash](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/24/ethereum-software-firm-consensys-reveals-it-collects-user-data/) over an update to its privacy policy in November, with users objecting to the collection of IP address information through RPC provider Infura and linking this to addresses and account balances. A [response](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/consensys-metamask-crypto-wallet-response-130000872.html) from ConsenSys in December clarified that they only collect data for "write" events (like making a transaction) and not when the user merely checks their balances, and that they have been doing this since 2018. They pledged to no longer store the IP data alongside the account access data, and to make it easier for users to change RPC provider through the interface.

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has been [puzzling](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4563283-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-rating-upgrade) and spooking some investors, as its "discount to NAV" (price of a share of the trust vs the value of the amount of Bitcoin one share represents) [increased](https://ycharts.com/companies/GBTC/discount_or_premium_to_nav) to a whopping 45%. In Summer 2022 Grayscale's application to convert the fund to an ETF was denied, so it is presently stuck in a position where investors cannot claim the BTC their shares entitle them to, although this decision is under appeal. Grayscale is owned by the Digital Currency Group, which also owns [troubled](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/01/05/crypto-broker-genesis-cuts-30-of-staff-reportedly-mulls-bankruptcy/) crypto lender Genesis, which had to suspend its operations in the wake of FTX's collapse, and in January cut 30% of its workforce. The Digital Currency Group owns many [companies](https://dcg.co/portfolio/) in the crypto space, and there has been some speculation about which of these they might sell to bail out the struggling ones. Their holdings include Coindesk, which broke the story about FTX which triggered the present difficulties for DCG. The cryptocurrency holdings of DCG have been the subject of some controversy, as Grayscale's [refusal](https://cryptopotato.com/grayscale-says-no-to-proof-of-reserves/) to participate in providing "Proof of Reserves" was one of the factors which caused suspicion initially - although Coinbase has stepped up to [vouch](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/coinbase-clears-about-grayscale-reserves) for their assets being safely held.

It has been a [tough year](https://www.forbes.com/sites/colinharper/2022/12/23/bitcoin-mining-in-2022-the-year-boom-turned-to-bust/) for Bitcoin miners, and in particular the Northern American industry which grew rapidly fuelled by cheap credit in 2021 and lured in by the gap left when China banned PoW mining. As the price of BTC declined by 63% in 2022 the industry was becoming more competitive, leading to a 70% drop in mining profitability. As the problems became clear the value of top mining machines declined 85% and the value of shares for the mining companies fell from between 80-98%. In December Core Scientific, one of the largest US crypto miners, has [filed](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-bankruptcy) for bankruptcy.

Avraham Eisenberg, the front man who took public credit for the "highly profitable trading strategy" which drained Mango Markets of $110 million, has ben [arrested](https://decrypt.co/118045/mango-markets-attacker-avraham-eisenberg-arrested-charged-with-market-manipulation-offenses) and charged with market manipulation offences.

Popular crypto news and research providers The Block were [revealed](https://twitter.com/fintechfrank/status/1601295493102911488) to be secretly bankrolled by SBF through Alameda, it looks like three loans were made to  Block CEO McCaffrey, one of which was used [buy](https://www.axios.com/2022/12/09/bankman-fried-funded-crypto-news-site-block) an apartment in the Bahamas. It appears that none of the Block's editorial staff were aware of the arrangement between SBF and McCaffrey, who has now resigned.

The Balancer DAO community [agreed](https://decrypt.co/117590/how-balancer-dao-achieved-peace-with-a-clever-whale-named-humpy) to a [peace treaty](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-128-peace-treaty/4128) with the veBAL (Balancer's governance token) whale who came to be known as Humpy. Humpy is the largest BAL holder and liquidity provider, and used their voting power to dominate Balancer's governance and increase the yield rates for the liquidity pools they were personally using. Balancer developers and the community mobilised to mitigate Humpy's self-dealing but Humpy was still able to extract significant profit by pointing BAL rewards to pools they created with high fee levels. The peace treaty was approved almost unanimously by the veBAL community in a token vote, Humpy agreed to not increase their BAL position any further and to unwind much of it, with assistance from community members to organise OTC trades.
