## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover its most notable dev work._
- _For each project, the order of reporting is "OLDEST FIRST", or "most released first": changes released to end users, merged to master, in progress (work started), discussions and future plans._
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

- _For each project:_
  - _Step 1: Add every commit in chronological order_
  - _Step 2: Organize:_
    - _released, master, progress, future_
    - _user-facing up top, dev stuff down below_
  - _Step 3: Group further and tidy_

BLAKE3 GPU mining:

- Added support for [BLAKE3 GPU mining via OpenCL](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/194). It includes a custom optimized BLAKE3 OpenCL kernel based on midstates for supporting GPUs that work with OpenCL and OpenCL with ADL. "Kernel" is a program written in a specialized [OpenCL kernel language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL#OpenCL_kernel_language) that runs on the GPU. This kernel seems to be much faster than some estimates for Blake3, for example WhatToMine rates [RTX 3070](https://whattomine.com/gpus/48-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070) at 2.4 GH/s (double BLAKE3) while gominer's implementation achieves [~10 GH/s](https://github.com/decred/gominer/tree/9b7fd18c4f9ffdf82ab9c5914a616c2956c53f68#user-reported-hashrates) on same GPU. This change also improves discovery of CL devices, randomizes nonces to ensure each device is doing different work, and improves displaying of hashrate values.
  - { _was #194 prepared in advance? It came super fast after GPUs showed up! When first private GPU miners were spotted?_ }
  - { _chat [mentioned](https://matrix.to/#/!TSpuyuYWgkTrgPTcXh:decred.org/$27J1Uw-rwgSzyUWVUQ4oZoiFyTKSpfmyDn92kAQ-HAw) this kernel is "quite a bit faster than the other blake3 stuff out there" - did it reference whattomine.com estimates or something else? i.e. can we show some numbers to compare this kernel vs other stuff and are these numbers reliable?_ }
- Added support for [BLAKE3 GPU mining with CUDA](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/195), another API for high performance computing on GPUs. This implementation uses the kernel from the OpenCL version with necessary changes to compile with the CUDA toolkit. Windows version of the CUDA build of gominer has not been validated as working yet. Unlike OpenCL, [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) is proprietary, closed source, and only works on Nvidia cards. 
  - { _Who would use CUDA if OpenCL is faster?_ }
- Fixed a [couple](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/204) of [issues](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/205) with the [Stratum](https://braiins.com/stratum-v1) protocol.

README updates:

- Switched Windows OpenCL build instructions to [MSYS2](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/196).
- Added OpenCL AMD/Nvidia [build instructions](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/198) for Linux.
- Added [configuration instructions](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/199).
- Added [user-reported hashrates](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/201).
- { omitting 202 }

In September the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 8,374 DCR worth $111K at September's average rate of $13.23. 

No Treasury spend transactions were mined in September due to a slip in the admin approval timeframe, but a [treasury spend tx](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/dad857ec261237d51247d4bfae1a1ffb4348c8a7ed8933b2b877e6cac1d75436) spending 8,411 DCR was mined on Oct 1 after being approved with 99.9% Yes votes and 64% turnout. This TSpend covers July and the majority of August's billing, in an effort to close the expanding gap between work being completed and being paid. It has 53 outputs ranging in size from 7 DCR to 1719 DCR. The billing rate for July was $15.40/DCR and for August $13.89/DCR, at the average of $14.65/DCR the payment would cover about $123K of costs for both months combined.

{ _Other interesting facts/stories about the legacy or new treasury._ }

As of Oct 5, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 866,862 DCR (11.4 million USD at $13.20).

Voting was completed for two proposals in September, but the voting period was disrupted by the activation of DCP-0011 and a period of around 2 days where the blockchain was stalled waiting for a new block to be found with the new hashing function, followed by a period of rapid block production as GPU miners began operating on the network. The delay of greater than 24 hours without a block caused certain safeguards to activate in the wallet software, which became convinced that the client must be offline and would have prevented normal voting behavior.  

* The Cryptopower multi asset Golang wallet for Desktop and Mobile [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/256efee) with a budget of $61,600 was approved with 69.6% Yes votes and 62% turnout. 

* The Cake Wallet integration proposal requesting $80,000 to integrate basic DCR functionality in Cake Wallet failed to reach the quorum requirement with 18% turnout, although it was on 87% approval. Cake Wallet voting was authorized and started after the Cryptopower proposal was already voting for more than 1 day, and as a result Cake Wallet suffered much more from the voting system problems.

There were two "new" proposals published this month, although one of them is a repeat of the Cake Wallet integration proposal.

* [Cake Wallet Integration Again](https://proposals.decred.org/record/b3bdacb) is back for another try at the quorum requirement.
* A fifth iteration of Lindseymmc's PR [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/0c04c6f) initially requested an increased amount of $60,000 for another year, then reduced to $48,000.

{ _Hints (all optional):_

_1. Besides dramatic "epic fails", try to also report "epic wins" in areas relevant to Decred. Balance is good and we can learn from both._

_2. Order the stories as follows:_

- _Crypto L1 tech: PoW, ASIC resistance, full nodes, network security, etc._
- _Crypto L2+ tech: "Smart" contracts, DEX projects_
- _Crypto governance, finances, transparency, funding, chain forks, community splits_
- _Relevant exchanges and websites_
- _Regulations, privacy, security_
- _Fun stuff_
