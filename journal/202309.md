## Network Upgrade and Service Outage

{ _which term is more accurate: network|chain|service stall|outage?_ }

On August 29 consensus changes [Change PoW to BLAKE3 and ASERT](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0011/dcp-0011.mediawiki) and [Change PoW/PoS Subsidy Split To 1/89](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0012/dcp-0012.mediawiki) activated on Decred mainnet at block 794,368.

Since the switch to BLAKE3 would remove all BLAKE-256 ASIC hashrate from the network, mining difficulty had to be reset to a low enough value to allow commodity hardware like CPUs or GPUs to mine new BLAKE3 blocks. For comparison, ASICs mined their last block [794,367](https://dcrdata.decred.org/block/0000000000000000c293d8c67409d05e960447ea25cdaf770e864d995c764ef0) at difficulty of 3.5 billion while the next block [794,368](https://dcrdata.decred.org/block/071683030010299ab13f139df59dc98d637957b766e47f8da6dd5ac762f1e8c7) had the difficulty value of 101 thousand, or 35,068 times lower.

The initial difficulty value targeted about 1.45 TH/s hashrate in [anticipation of GPU mining](https://matrix.to/#/!TSpuyuYWgkTrgPTcXh:decred.org/$mtTPqh-YoNoXn-Q8-Q8K0390wy28L4XrD8Udx9yDU6U). GPU miners did not immediately join the network as expected however, and CPU miners were left with difficulty that is extremely high for CPUs. Single CPU achieves between ~5-75 megahashes per second (ranging from old laptops to latest desktop CPUs). Assuming an "average CPU" as 20 MH/s, getting 1.45 *terahashes* would require some 72,500 CPUs. Block 794,368 was extremely lucky to be found in 50 minutes, assuming it was found with CPUs, but then the chain stalled for days.

Any services depending on the chain getting new blocks got suspended, for example: deposits and withdrawals at centralized exchanges were disabled, DCR swaps at DCRDEX could not start or complete, timestamping services were suspended, Politeia could not start or stop proposal voting, Politeia voting software was not operating normally (casting votes required hacks and tricks), LN channels could not be opened or closed, Bison Relay functionality was restricted (could not deposit or withdraw to/from wallets, could not open/close LN channels).

In a positive development, this incident has activated many old and new community members to come together and push the chain forward. Dozens of hobby miners fired up CPU mining on their desktops, laptops, closet NAS and even Raspberry Pi, and endured the generated heat. After a day of no blocks miners faced an [issue](https://matrix.to/#/!TSpuyuYWgkTrgPTcXh:decred.org/$amWpGnQxOVmrNlYkiTepTpL3UcufPrCTcKBnHU5cgTo) where dcrd would refuse to build on top of blocks older than 24 hours, the workaround was to set back the clock and [regenerate certificates](https://matrix.to/#/!TSpuyuYWgkTrgPTcXh:decred.org/$BpCzc15FJXrhB-VnrcRx18sTCZ2bZ-Ok2Hg0Wcw7n3Y) if necessary.

After almost 3 days with no new blocks @grumlin and @davecgh turned to [cloud hashrate](https://matrix.to/#/!TSpuyuYWgkTrgPTcXh:decred.org/$-Ql5Vva-X-A2ds34OYP0HZZs8O8fsikHIeTH6zlN9yU) and within ~3 hours [block 794,369](https://dcrdata.decred.org/block/655d0c998b6f838a63a69991ebfb8dc776ed0234117c7b6cca407fe15c2cb02c) was [found](https://matrix.to/#/!TSpuyuYWgkTrgPTcXh:decred.org/$s5YhsGnMnTGaWnNLHGWD6CSKXYfoTxNklSFeKuS7zb4), it was 324 KB in size and included 240 transactions accumulated over the days. Due to prolonged period without blocks some dcrd-s hit a path where they weren't trying to fetch new blocks and those full nodes had to be restarted. After that the difficulty was quickly adjusted by the new ASERT algorithm and block times normalized within hours.

This 2.9 day outage has set a new record, beating the [previous outage](https://forum.decred.org/threads/04-23-17-pow-mining-outage.5287/) in [April 2017](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/856193098879299584) when it took 9.6 hours to mine [block 127,072](https://dcrdata.decred.org/block/127072).

## Decred GPU Mining Software

GPU mining has kicked in one week after the hardfork and quickly displaced CPU mining. Two software options for GPU mining Decred have been publicly released in September:

- [gominer](https://github.com/decred/gominer) supports Decred mining on OpenCL and CUDA devices, including AMD and Nvidia GPUs. Binaries are currently not available but the build and setup process is [well documented](https://github.com/decred/gominer#readme).

- [BzMiner](https://www.bzminer.com/) supports mining Decred on AMD, Nvidia and Intel GPUs since version 17.0.0. The source code is not public but BzMiner has a long list of [features](https://github.com/bzminer/bzminer) and can achieve higher hashrates compared to gominer. The binaries are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bzminer/bzminer/releases) and [bzminer.com](https://www.bzminer.com/).

<a id="bison-relay-v019-release" />

## Bison Relay v0.1.9 Release

This release improves posts UX, key exchange maintenance, and fixes bugs reported in v0.1.8.

Notable changes in both GUI and text apps:

- Automatic handshakes with users idle for 21 days to keep the contacts alive
- Automatic unsubscribing and kicking from group chats of users idle for 60 days
- Exclude list to prevent automatic unsubscriptions for certain users, such as well-known bots

GUI app highlights:

- Improved listing of user's posts
- A button to reset all old key exchanges
- First round of mobile UI design implementation (can be tested by reducing the window width below 500 px)
- Fixed: getting stuck on the setting up flow, opening of URL links, and incorrect visibility of unread indicators

Text app highlights:

- Fixed various issues with Simplestore
- Fixed browsing of local pages
- Fixed UI bugs with chat

Full release notes and downloads can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/releases/tag/v0.1.9). It is recommended to verify the files as described in the [README](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/tree/v0.1.9#verifying-binaries).


<a id="dcrdex-v063-release" />

## DCRDEX v0.6.3 Release

This release contains several important fixes and improvements. All users are advised to update. Highlights for the standalone app:

- Trade limits scale with bond level
- Fixed a common error that arose when rescanning the builtin BTC wallet
- Fixed a scenario where bonds could fully expire before being replaced

Read the full release notes [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.6.3).

Note: As of writing dexc binaries are also available as part of the [core v1.8.1 release](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.8.1). These binaries offer a number of advantages: they are signed with Decred Release key, support more operating system and CPU architectures, and are built with a newer and more optimized Go toolchain.


<a id="development" />

## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Changes backported to the v1.8.1 release:

- Added the new [proof of work hash](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3192) to the verbose outputs of `getblock` and `getblockheader`.
- Changed the [`getnetworkhashps`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3181) to treat `-1` as a default value (120 blocks back). Previous meaning of `-1` "the number of blocks since last difficulty change" no longer makes sense given that the difficulty is now calculated every block as opposed to every 144 blocks with the old difficulty algorithm.

Changes merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Updated Docker image to [Go 1.21.1](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3183).
- Improved internal [error handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3182) in the `rpcserver` to make the code cleaner and harder to misuse.
- Changed [`sampleconfig`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3185) package to use Go's embed functionality. It allows to have sample configs as separate files that are easier to work with, while retaining convenient access to their contents from code.
- Added functions to access the [R and S values](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3188) of signatures in the `secp256k1/ecdsa` package, these values can be useful in some computations.
- Added a couple of [new](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3190) [tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3191) to push test coverage to 99.6%.
- Minor changes { _drop after review: 3186, 3189_ }


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

Changes backported to the v1.8.1 release:

- Updated verbose [`getblock` and `getblockhash`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2285) responses to include the new proof of work hash.

Changes merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Updated [VSP fee calculation](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2281) for the new block reward split in DCP-12 (proof of stake reward increased from 80% to 89%). This piece of code is only used by vspd servers so this didn't need to be backported.

{ _omitting minor: 2282, 2288_ }


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

All changes below have been included in the v1.8.1 release (published in October).

Ledger integration:

- Added [backend functions](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3869) for interacting with Ledger. This is using [WebUSB](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/36289) API which allows Electron-based apps to access USB devices.
- Added [Ledger UI](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3874) for testnet.
- Enabled Ledger on [mainnet](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3906). This has been tested on Linux, Windows and macOS on Nano X and Nano S Plus devices.
- Rolled back [Electron](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3912) to v21.2.3 because the newer version caused issues with the DEX window. This will need to be [investigated and fixed](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/3921) in a future release because [Electron v23](https://releases.electronjs.org/release/v23.0.0) is needed for WebUSB support, which powers Ledger integration in Decrediton.

Other:

- Updated [DCRDEX module](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3905) to v0.6.3 and enabled its new "extension mode" to protect Decrediton's wallet from being misconfigured in the DEX window.
- Updated [Chinese translation](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3893).
- Updated web dependencies { _3898, 3894, 3891, 3890, 3904_ }
- Fixes { _3900 (async), 3887 (perms)_ }
- Tweaks to [tutorial text](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3892). { _may group_ }


### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software used by Voting Service Providers. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

September's vspd work made incremental quality of life improvements for users, admins and developers.

All changes below have been included in [v1.3.0](https://github.com/decred/vspd/releases/tag/release-v1.3.0) and [v1.3.1](https://github.com/decred/vspd/releases/tag/release-v1.3.1) releases which came out in September.

User-facing changes:

- Added separate expired and missed ticket counts on the VSP [home page](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/417) and in the [`/vspinfo` response](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/421). The "revoked tickets" reported currently is a sum of expired and missed, having missed tickets separately is a better metric for evaluating VSP's reliability because expired tickets are not VSP's fault.
- Updated [VSP fee calculations](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/435) to consider the new block reward split in DCP-12.
- A new yellow top banner will appear if the VSP is running on [testnet or simnet](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/417). [Debug banner](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/443) has been changed to red color because debug mode should not be used in production.

Changes for VSP admins:

- Added a new admin page that lists all tickets which were registered with the VSP but [missed their votes](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/451).
- Optimized [discovery of voted and revoked tickets](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/416) to run twice as fast. This is achieved by using a different [matching function](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/dc41075594cfdef63e8a64340b4fc5651a56a604/gcs/gcs.go#L304) from dcrd's `gcs` package that is [better optimized](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/413#issuecomment-1694228745) for this job.
- Improved responsiveness of handling [shutdown requests](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/426) by adding cancellation to startup processes and long-running background tasks. Also removed some duplicate boilerplate code.
- Ensure [startup/shutdown messages](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/427) are always the first/last thing to be logged.
- Improved compatibility of handling [shutdown signals](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/438) on various OSes.
- Changed the web API to return [explicit errors](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/440) if the web API cache is not ready. This will make the admin immediately aware of a possible issue. Previously if the cache was not ready web pages were rendered with no data and no indication of anything being wrong.
- Tweaked [logging](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/445) to reduce unnecessary spam.
- Added release notes for [v1.3.0](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/447) and [v1.3.1](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/452).

Internal and developer changes:

- Restored the ability to run [vspd on simnet](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/419), this is needed by DCRDEX to test new VSP staking features.
- Small performance optimizations by making [better use of dcrd](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/422).
- Unexported some code and [moved](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/428) it to [internal](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/430) [packages](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/436) since it is not suitable for consuming by third parties. Smaller public API surface makes development and maintenance easier.
- Reworked how components are [created, started](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/434), and [stopped](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/436) to decouple and simplify code.
- Fixed [database backup](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/439) running only once instead of running periodically (unreleased bug).
- ~20 commits with smaller improvements and code cleanup.
  - { _drop after review: 423 (spent scan fix), 433 (move), 429 (import kill), 432 (unparam), 431 (minor opti), 437 (rename), 441 (unused), 444 (x4 decomp, renames), 449 (deps), 446 (x8 minor cleanups and tweaks), 450 (ver)_ }

### gominer

_[gominer](https://github.com/decred/gominer) { intro }_

The switch to BLAKE3 mining has triggered a refresh of the gominer codebase after almost 3 years of little development activity.

The main goal of September's gominer development was to quickly react to the first GPU miners who did not share their code publicly and began to dominate the hashrate, and allow anyone to mine with their GPUs. Besides adding BLAKE3 GPU mining support, effort has been made to automate or document the setup process to address multiple pain points reported by the miners.

BLAKE3 GPU mining:

- Added support for [BLAKE3 GPU mining via OpenCL](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/194). It includes a custom optimized BLAKE3 OpenCL kernel based on midstates for supporting GPUs that work with OpenCL and OpenCL with ADL. "Kernel" is a program written in a specialized [OpenCL kernel language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL#OpenCL_kernel_language) that runs on the GPU. This change also improves discovery of CL devices, randomizes nonces to ensure each device is doing different work, and improves displaying of hashrate values.
- Added support for [BLAKE3 GPU mining with CUDA](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/195) on Linux. CUDA is a platform for high performance computing on GPUs. The OpenCL kernel has been adjusted to compile with the CUDA toolkit. Unlike OpenCL, [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) is proprietary, closed source, and only works on Nvidia cards. However, CUDA allows to control overclocks and fan speeds to potentially significantly increase efficiency (gigahashes per watt). Given the cost of electricity is a huge factor in profitability, such tradeoffs often make sense.
- Added a script and instructions for building the CUDA-enabled version of gominer on [Windows](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/206). Building a Go program with CUDA support is [more complicated](https://github.com/decred/gominer/blob/7e2fb9e40e5568d4c85636c7c7ef1474eb44cf6c/cuda_builder.go#L5) on Windows than on Linux, but the new builder goes to great lengths to automate as much as possible. If a missing dependency or environment configuration is detected, the builder will print human-readable directions how to resolve the issue. [Manual instructions](https://github.com/decred/gominer/blob/7e2fb9e40e5568d4c85636c7c7ef1474eb44cf6c/docs/cuda-manual-windows-build.md) have been added as a fallback in case the automatic builder does not work. This change also removes a dependency on GNU Make.
- Added support for [CUDA versions older than 10](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/216). This enables building gominer on more configurations, although performance will be significantly degraded with older CUDA versions. Installed CUDA toolkit version and GPU architecture will be [detected automatically](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/n/commits/a7076d78a46f9b9d9277fb3f92620ed130d5e7e9) during build to use the best possible GPU features, specifically the fast [funnel shift](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12767113/funnel-shift-what-is-it) intrinsic.
- Fixed an issue where [autocalibration](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/218/commits/d3e68cf1e370e94eb50b1e74d5b2446b8e24c4ad) could not release the device and make the actual mining loop fail.

GPU programming is not something the developers do every day but this OpenCL kernel has shown to be quite fast. For example, it achieves 10-12 GH/s on an RTX 3070, which is close to 12 GH/s reported by [WhatToMine](https://whattomine.com/gpus/48-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070) for IronFish, another mining algorithm based on BLAKE3. A better comparison would need to consider the details (size of the hashed data, number of hashing rounds, etc.), but the hashrates reported so far suggest that gominer is good enough to make GPU mining fairer and accessible to more people.

README updates:

- Switched Windows OpenCL build instructions to [MSYS2](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/196).
- Added OpenCL AMD/Nvidia [build instructions](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/198) for Linux.
- Added [configuration instructions](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/199).
- Added [user-reported hashrates](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/201).

Other changes:

- Improved [shutdown handling](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/207).
- 14 [housekeeping](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/210) and clean up commits including the addition of more linters to prevent poor code from getting in.
- Fixed a [couple](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/204) of [issues](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/205) with the [Stratum](https://braiins.com/stratum-v1) protocol.

### dcrpool

_[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool) is server software for running a mining pool._

Similar to gominer, dcrpool development has been reactivated after a period of low activity since summer 2021 when release v1.2.0 came out. The developers upgraded the codebase to latest Go features, fixed multiple concurrency and shutdown edge cases, and paid some technical debt, all in preparation of adding pooled GPU mining support.

Upgrades and changes:

- Added [BLAKE3 support](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/341) to the internal CPU miner which is used for testing.
- Improved accuracy when calculating the number of [possible iterations](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/360).
- Improved log messages to trace [clients that time out](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/376).
- Improved [signal handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/381) to shut down more cleanly on more variants of Unix as well as on Windows in response to things such as the user logging off, the terminal being closed, or the system shutting down.
- Updated [build code](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/386) to use Go 1.21 and PostgreSQL 16.0.
- Removed all bbolt [database upgrades](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/391) and reset the database version to 1. This allows to remove a significant amount of code which no longer needs to be maintained, gives developers flexibility to change the database format before the next release, and may avoid potential bugs and support issues caused by inconsistent data. This change assumes there have been no known public deployments of dcrpool and suggests to label the next release v2.0.0 to reflect that the database format is incompatible with the last major version v1.2.0.

Fixes:

- Corrected [shutdown logic](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/351) to ensure that log files are properly closed if the process exits due to an error.
- Fixed some cases where configuration [errors were not being logged](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/352) as expected, and removed code duplication.
- Ensure the [database is closed](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/353) on all error paths.
- Check if the app is shutting down before sending [internal messages](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/367). { _may group (shutdown fixes)_ }
- Fixed stratum endpoint not [stopping cleanly](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/359) during app shutdown. { _may group (shutdown fixes)_ }
- [Fail fast](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/377) if the GUI web server's listen port is already in use. Before this change, if the GUI could not start normally dcrpool process would continue to run, which is not an expected behavior. Now the process will terminate quickly and allow the admin to resolve any issues immediately.
- Fixed edge cases where duplicate [work share IDs](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/390) and [payment IDs](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/392) could be generated. Random numbers have been added to these IDs to ensure they are unique. This fixes test failures on fast hardware.
- Miscellaneous fixes in concurrency, cancellation, shutdown logic, and error handling.
  - { _drop after review: 354 (err h), 372 (err h), 375 (client goroutine leak), 394 (paymgr goroutine leak), 395 (process pmts goroutine leak), 396 (paymgr races), 397 (sh down panic)_ }

Refactoring:

- Removed unused code for running dcrpool as a [Windows](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/342) [service](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/349).
- Made various code cleanups and enabled new linters.
  - { _drop after review: comments and errors (343, 344, 345, 346, 347), unused code (350, 379), formatting (362), deprecations (393)_ }
- Reworked how app [version numbers are handled](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/355) to use a more robust approach from dcrd and dcrwallet.
- Reworked lifecycles of several subsystems to make their startup and shutdown more reliable, easier to reason about, and protected from unintended future changes. The subsystems are: [pool hub](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/356), [GUI](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/370) [web server](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/371), [pool endpoint and client](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/373), and [chain state](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/378). Handling of disconnecting [pool clients](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/380) has been simplified.
- Made the `gui` package [internal](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/357) since it is not intended for external consumers.
- Improved concurrency coordination.
  - { _358 (waitgroup)_ }
- Small memory management improvements.
  - { _361 (net params), 365, 363, 366, 364_ }
- Updates to newer Go features.
  - { _383 - may group with minor changes_ }
- Minor changes { _369, 382_ }

Documentation:

- Added latest [tested versions](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/384) of PostgreSQL and updated best practices of creating the database.
- Updated and simplified [build and setup instructions](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/385).

Test code:

- Read from compressed test data archive [in chunks](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/348) - a good practice to avoid uncontrolled allocations.
- Made test harness easier to run on [Windows](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/368).
- Made [endpoint tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/387) more robust.
- Allow to [keep the test database](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/389) for inspection after test failure.
- Removed all code related to ASICs that can no longer mine Decred and are no longer supported by dcrpool. { _398, 399, 400_ }


### Lightning Network

_[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant and low-cost transactions._

- Removed custom config to target [100 peer connections](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/190) (it was [inherited](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/d233f61383f2f950aa06f5b09da5b0e78e784fae/server.go#L1413) from lnd).
- Fixed [startup failure](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/191) if `--routing` options are not set.
- Build and test against [Go 1.21](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/192).
- [v0.4.0 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/releases/tag/v0.4.0) has been tagged to mark the revision included in core software v1.8.0 release.


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

September changes included in the [v0.6.3 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.6.3):

- Added [extension mode](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2486), a restricted mode where DCRDEX won't allow to change settings like wallet type, wallet password, or wallet accounts. This will protect the wallet from misconfiguration when the DEX is running as part of Decrediton.
- Removed ["bonus tiers"](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2502), which were an "accounting curiosity" on the server that didn't do anything for the client but did introduce a bug where client's bonds would fully expire before being replaced.

Work below has been merged to `master` towards future releases.

Decred:

- Added minimal [GUI for VSP staking](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2482) with the following features: select a VSP, view current ticket price and voting rewards, purchase tickets, view all-time staking stats, view a list of owned tickets, view and set voting preferences (consensus agendas, treasury spends, and treasury keys).
- Allow to specify a [custom VSP](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2529) that is not listed in the [VSP API](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/blob/master/docs/api.md).

Firo:

- Implemented Firo [block parsing](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2488) to enable fee estimation on testnet.
- Minor fixes. { _2494 (harness), 2495 (docs and typos), 2506_ }

Ethereum:

- Implemented [WebSocket subscriptions](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2490) so the DEX server could get new block headers from chain data provider more efficiently than by polling them. When HTTP polling is still used, poll interval will automatically increase for non-local sources. Changing this interval required to rebuild the server previously.
- Added more [free data providers](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2514) that can be used in testing. { _may group_ }
- Implemented a smart contract for [getting balances](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2520) of ETH and any number of tokens to greatly reduce the request rate to providers. Also added a cache for responces to further reduce requests to providers between blocks.

Polygon (MATIC):

- Changes across the board to finish the initial [Polygon support](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2431): generalized the Ethereum wallet and server backend to reuse common code, added RPC compatibility tests, added Polygon token support to the test harness and gas estimation, deployed USDC swap contract on Polygon mainnet, updated token-related UI code. For user convenience Polygon and Ethereum wallets will use the same seed and derive the same private keys and addresses as [discussed here](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2431#issuecomment-1650510000).
- Added support for wrapped tokens [WBTC and WETH](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2522) and adjusted gas rates based on testing results.

Client GUI:

- Improved [active orders UI](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2171): show live orders and recent orders in one table, and show buttons when hovering an order so the user could perform actions without expanding the rows.
- Show [average traded rate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2463) in several places.
- Skip redundant [password entry step](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2542) when creating an account on the DEX server if the password is cached.

Client backend:

- Implemented [asynchronous notifications](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2492) that wallets can send to the GUI. This will allow to solve some issues and keep the GUI up-to-date in more situations.
- Added interfaces to retreive the [history of wallet transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2500) (actual implementation will be done in future changes). { _may group_ }
- Allow the client to connect to DEX servers using certificates provided by trusted [Certificate Authorities](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2513). Previously server certificate had to be configured manually.
- Optimized [exchange rates fetching](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2512) logic and timeouts.
- Fixed the possibility of unexpected [bond expiration](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2460) and cancellation of all orders. Client uses account tier information from the server to decide how many bonds to queue up. If the client is targeting tier 1 and has no good behavior recorded by the server it will create a new bond before the last one runs out to stay bonded. However if the server tells the client they are tier 2 because of good behavior, the client will assume it does not need to create a new bond when the last bond is about to expire, and when that happens, the tier will suddenly drop to 0, cancelling all orders.

Client, trading bots:

- Implemented an [arbitrage bot](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2480) with a simple strategy which only places orders when there is an arbitrage opportunity between the DEX and a centralized exchange (initially supporting Binance).
- Updated [market making UI](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2491), now it includes an overview page with all configured market makers and settings pages for each. The configuration is stored in a JSON file. The markets page is also updated to not allow users to place orders manually while market making is running.
- Fixed the market maker bot to [rebalance](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2517) a bit later, when the necessary matches data is available.

Documentation:

- Updated [wallet recovery and rescanning guide](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2473) for the built-in (aka native) BTC wallet.
- Added [release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2536) for v0.6.3.
- { _omitting: 2516, 2533, 2539_ }

Server:

- Allow to [disable a market](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2487) in the config file.
- Allow the server to run [without TLS encryption](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2515), for example for setups where encryption is handled by nginx.
- Added a [reverse tunnel](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2493) for obtaining chain data services. Instead of DEX server connecting to data providers, they can initiate connections to a public DEX server and provide RPC services. This allows obtaining chain data from private nodes that cannot accept connections. Having an integrated reverse tunnel offers some advantages over SSH tunneling used previously to achieve the same goal, such as simple configuration. DEX server can consume from multiple source nodes for redundancy.

Other:

- Increased [minimum Go version](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2521) to 1.19.
- Fixed desktop build on [Debian](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2525).
- Added a script for setting up [two wallets](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2535) for manual testing on mainnet and testnet. This allows to test more scenarios.

### Cryptopower

_[Cryptopower](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower) is a multi-coin desktop GUI wallet for DCR, BTC, and LTC. It runs in a privacy-preserving light SPV mode without needing full blockchains, supports Decred staking, mixing, voting, and other unique features._

All changes below have been merged to `master` towards future releases.

New Overview page:

- Implemented new [Home page](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/65) design with dummy data and reorganized features into 3 high-level tabs: Overview, Wallets and Trade.
  - { _65 (dummy tabs), 68 (layout fixes), 75 (impl with dummy data)_ }
- Use real data in [recent trades](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/104) cards.
- Use real wallet data in [balance cards](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/115).
- Added a modal showing [total asset value](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/68/commits/f393b5304359f16df92d385e7f93fcc24567692d) in USD.

DEX integration:

- Added first step of [DEX onboarding](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/119).

User-facing changes:

- Show [loading indicator](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/73) while the list of VSPs is being loaded.
- Hide [mixing progress bar](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/70) when mixer is not running.
- Persist [balance hiding](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/81) setting across app restarts.
- Added a modal for [receiving funds](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/108) that can be accessed from anywhere by clicking the Receive button.

User-facing fixes:

- Fixed [missing icons](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/64) in Recent Orders list of the instant exchange feature.
- Fixed [staking transactions](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/92) being listed in Transaction Overview instead of Staking Activities.
- Fixed width of the [asset balance card](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/95) on the Overview page.
- Fixed [Home page](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/105) not being shown after successfully creating or restoring a wallet.
- Fixed total USD balance and notification bell invisible in [dark mode](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/132).
- Fixed crash when loading the app to the [Overview page](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/133).
- Fixed crash when clicking on a [staking transaction](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/136).

Litecoin:

- Fixed [address discovery](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/59) unnecessarily running after every app restart.

Android:

- Created a prototype [Kotlin project](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower-android).
- Fixed app launch on Android 11+ by storing data in [app's private directory](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/pull/116). As an added advantage, this makes app files not accessible to other apps.

Internal and developer changes:

- Fixed issues with some [instant exchanges](https://github.com/crypto-power/instantswap/pull/6) in the `instantswap` library.
- Removed unused code. { _66_ }

### Documentation

_[dcrdocs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs) is the source code for Decred [user documentation](https://docs.decred.org/)._

- [Updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1228) the [Proof-of-Work](https://docs.decred.org/mining/overview/) page removing the legacy documents related to ASICs and added information about BLAKE3 and CPU mining.
- Updated the [project history](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1232) timeline adding notable events like the launch of Bison Relay, GPU mining for BLAKE3, and the block reward change.
- Added the `blake3pow` and `changesubsidysplitr2` [agendas](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1231) to the [Consensus Vote Archive](https://docs.decred.org/governance/consensus-rule-voting/consensus-vote-archive/).


### decred.org

_[dcrweb](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb) is the source code for the [decred.org](https://decred.org/) website._

- Updated [press release](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1136) formatting.
- Updated the [Arabic translation](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1140).


### Bison Relay

_[Bison Relay](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay) is a new social media platform with strong protections against censorship, surveillance, and advertising, powered by Decred Lightning Network._

September changes in both GUI and text apps included in v0.1.9 release:

- Show the dates of contact [creation and last handshake attempt](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/348).
- Added an [ignore list to automatic unsubscription of idle users](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/349). Users in this list will not be automatically unsubscribed or removed from group chats even if they are idle. By default it includes well-known bots (Oprah and GC bot) but more users can be added using the new config file option `autoremoveignorelist`.

GUI app changes included in v0.1.9 release:

- Implemented first round of [mobile-optimized UI design](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/334). This covers the unlock screen, LN overview, feed posts, mobile drawer/sidebar, chat lists, and new icons. Mobile layouts can be tested by reducing the window width below 500 px.
- Updated mobile design for [direct and group chats](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/343) and added date change indicator.
- Improved [listing of user's posts](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/300). Previously it was just text in the direct chat window, the new listing will look similar to News Feed and indicate whether posts have been downloaded or not. User menu has been tuned to show "Subscribe to Posts" item if not subscribed and "List Posts" and "Unsubscribe to Posts" items if subscribed.
- Added a button to the Settings page that attempts [reset all old key exchanges](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/345) with stale users. The period of no activity that is considered "stale" is taken from the server.
- Fixed [inability to add LN capacity](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/338) after all LN channels had been closed and the app had been restarted.
- Fixed [new comments indicator](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/342) not disappearing when a post has been viewed, fixed new chat indicator not appearing on new messages.
- Fixed [unnecessary redrawing](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/344) of messages.
- Fixed crash of the [unlock page](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/353) on small (mobile) screens.

brclient changes included in v0.1.9 release:

- Made `/list runningtips` command [return an error](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/347) if no tip attempts are running.
- Fixed issues when interacting with local [Pages and Stores](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/335). `/ln payinvoice` command now understands the `lnpay://` prefix in invoice links. "Order Completed" page enhanced to show order details and the validity of the invoice (1 hour). If LN invoice creation fails, for example if the seller does not have enough inbound LN capacity, an on-chain payment address will be created instead as a fallback.

In September the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 8,374 DCR worth $111K at September's average rate of $13.23. 

No Treasury spend transactions were mined in September due to a slip in the admin approval timeframe, but a [treasury spend tx](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/dad857ec261237d51247d4bfae1a1ffb4348c8a7ed8933b2b877e6cac1d75436) spending 8,411 DCR was mined on Oct 1 after being approved with 99.9% Yes votes and 64% turnout, the highest so far. This TSpend covers July and the majority of August's billing, in an effort to close the expanding gap between work being completed and being paid. It has 53 outputs ranging in size from 7 DCR to 1,719 DCR. The billing rate for July was $15.40/DCR and for August $13.89/DCR, at the average of $14.65/DCR the payment would cover about $123K of costs for both months combined.

{ _Other interesting facts/stories about the legacy or new treasury._ }

As of Oct 5, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 866,862 DCR (11.4 million USD at $13.20).

Voting was completed for two proposals in September, but the voting period was disrupted by the activation of DCP-0011 and a period of around 3 days where the blockchain was stalled waiting for a new block to be found with the new hashing function, followed by a period of rapid block production as GPU miners began operating on the network. The delay of greater than 24 hours without a block caused certain safeguards to activate in the wallet software, which became convinced that the client must be offline and would have prevented normal voting behavior.

- The Cryptopower multi-asset Golang wallet for Desktop and Mobile [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/256efee) with a budget of $61,600 was approved with 69.6% Yes votes and 62% turnout.

- The Cake Wallet integration [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/2f25f2d) requesting $80,000 to integrate basic DCR functionality in [Cake Wallet](https://cakewallet.com/) failed to reach the quorum requirement with 18% turnout, although it was on 87% approval. Cake Wallet voting was authorized and started after the Cryptopower proposal was already voting for more than 1 day, and as a result Cake Wallet suffered much more from the voting system problems.

There were two proposals published this month, although one of them is a repeat of the Cake Wallet integration proposal.

- [Cake Wallet Integration Again](https://proposals.decred.org/record/b3bdacb) is back for another try at the quorum requirement.

- A fifth iteration of @l1ndseymm's [Public Relations proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/0c04c6f) initially requested an increased amount of $60,000 for another year, then reduced to $48,000.

## Mining

Developers anticipated that it wouldn't take long before GPU miners showed up given that even a single GPU mines as fast as roughly 500 CPUs, and GPU *farms* are common among miners. First signs of GPU mining got spotted around September 2nd but it wasn't definitive because they seemed to be intentionally keeping it in the range of plausible deniability. A more reliable confirmation has been made on 5th, and after working non-stop the first GPU mining patch has been merged on 6th.

**Hashrate**: September's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) opened at ~0 TH/s and closed ~8.8 TH/s, bottoming at 0 TH/s and peaking at 8.8 TH/s throughout the month.

There is no information about DCR mining pools in September.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between 141-278 DCR.

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) was 8.52-9.82 million DCR, meaning that 54.9-63.5% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) in proof of stake.

## Ecosystem

Voting Service Providers:

- Welcome [vote.dcr-swiss.ch](https://vote.dcr-swiss.ch/), a new VSP [listed](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pull/178) in the VSP API and on the [VSP page](https://decred.org/vsp/). DCR Swiss has a low fee of 0.25%. Out of 15 existing VSPs this is the fourth lowest fee after dcrhive.com (0.15%), dcr.farm (0.15%), and vspd.bass.cf (0.2%). As of writing the VSP reports 391 voted, 0 revoked, and 334 live tickets.

Exchanges:

- Poloniex users who transacted in DCR in 2017-2019 may be eligible for compensation if claims are submitted by October 31, 2023. This is a result of SEC's [proceedings](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement/information-for-harmed-investors/poloniex) against Poloniex from 2021. See more details on the [Poloniex Fair Fund](https://www.poloniexfairfund.com/) website and its [FAQ section](https://www.poloniexfairfund.com/frequently-asked-questions.aspx).

- KuCoin and Huobi have been [re-added](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1139) tp [Exchanges](https://decred.org/exchanges/) page. Apparently Huobi never delisted DCR as [planned](https://web.archive.org/web/20221002130913/https://www.huobi.com/support/en-us/detail/104917015223952), while KuCoin had fixed [DCR issues](https://www.kucoin.com/news/en-kucoin-opens-mainnet-dcr-tokens-deposit-and-withdrawal-services-20220924) some time ago. Hotbit has been removed following its closure in [May 2023](202305.md#ecosystem).

- [Changelly.com](https://changelly.com/) was observed to no longer have DCR trading on September 19th. Their [System Health](https://pro.changelly.com/system-monitor) dashboard did not list DCR either, even in maintenance mode. In a response to a support ticket, Changelly replied that DCR was switched off due to "its maintenance" (possibly referring to the Aug 29 hardfork) and that it will be back at some point.

- Binance is selling the entirety of its Russia business to CommEx, according to their [tweet](https://twitter.com/binance/status/1706944096688885895) and a [blog post](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/all/binance-fully-exits-russia-with-sale-to-commex-8578760889994024403). The stated reason is "operating in Russia is not compatible with Binance's compliance strategy". A gradual migration process has been announced to move Russian users to CommEx, after which Binance could sunset all exchange services and business in Russia. The impact on DCR services and whether CommEx will list DCR is currently unknown.

Other news:

- A phishing site that was a near perfect clone of the official [decred.org](https://decred.org) but with an added "community airdrop" was briefly advertised in Decred's Telegram channels. These messages were taken down within minutes after being posted. Site's page source suggested it was targeting the users of MetaMask, Coinbase and other browser-based wallets. As a reminder, do not click any random links, and ignore DMs instructing to do otherwise. The official Decred website is [decred.org](https://decred.org) with a certificate from Gandi.

The debate around Drivechains for Bitcoin and BIP-300 has [reignited](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-bip300-drivechain-proposal-sparks-debate-and-alternate-solutions) after lukedashjr wrote an implementation. There are discussions about whether this kind of sidechain which would allow for flexible creation and use of other assets would be a positive for Bitcoin, whether there are technical downsides or if allowing people to create scam-like assets on Bitcoin is the worst aspect. There are also discussions about how to activate the soft fork, with already some miners [signalling](https://twitter.com/francispouliot_/status/1697633126497882143) support. A new player entered the mix in September with claims of being able to operate a sidechain with a two-way peg on Bitcoin without any soft fork changes, but they as yet had no explanation which people could make sense of.

Paxos [accidentally](https://cointelegraph.com/news/miner-returns-over-500k-btc-transaction-fee-overpayment-paxos) paid 19.8 BTC for a Bitcoin transaction, but F2Pool apparently returned the BTC.

The Brave browser [announced](https://brave.com/web3-privacy/) a partnership with Electronic Coin Company to add Zcash support to its wallet, and to develop a "private and decentralized messaging feature" with the support of Filecoin and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).

Nouns DAO, which auctions off NFTs one per day to fund a treasury and had amassed a sum of around $50 million in this fashion, underwent a [fork](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/21/nouns-daos-27m-revolt-reveals-toxic-mix-of-money-hungry-traders-and-blockchain-idealists/) which saw over half of this value exiting through a newly introduced quit mechanism. The Nouns DAO is controlled by voting of the holders of Noun NFTs, and this community had long been split between a camp which embodied the original spirit of using the fund to promote the Nouns meme, and a camp which was disturbed by frivolous spending like $90,000 on naming a frog species, and which saw themselves as entitled to some share of the fund proportional to the number of Nouns NFTs and voting power they had. As the product of a long running discussion, v3 of the Nouns DAO's contracts incorporated a mechanism that allowed 20% of the NFTs to trigger a weeklong forking discussion and voting period. The majority of Nouns holders chose to exit and their share of the funds is now moved to a new DAO that has a ragequit mechanism, in addition to the familiar mechanisms of Nouns DAO, which will allow them to further exit and claim their individual share of that balance, if they so desire.

Terra Classic is to [cease](https://cointelegraph.com/news/terra-classic-cease-ustc-minting) minting and reminting of USTC in hopes of returning it to parity with the US dollar, after a vote with 59% in favour of the proposal. Since the LUNC price declined there are concerns about spam and a proposal to increase the minimum deposit amount to 5 million LUNC was approved with 93% support. 

Coinbase, in its role as an Ethereum validator, [received](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/15/coinbase-inadvertently-earned-1m-due-to-hack-but-hasnt-reimbursed-victims/) a 570 ETH MEV payment from the Curve hackers in July to prioritise the transactions which allowed them to profit from the attack. That's about $1 million profit for Coinbase at the moment, and they seem reluctant to return it to the damaged party, Alchemix, citing legal opinion that they are under no obligation to do so.

The SEC agreed a settlement in which the makers of the Stoner Cats NTF collection and associated web series were [fined](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/09/14/the-inanity-of-the-sec-stoner-cat-action/) $1 million and had to kill all the Cats in its possession. The case attracted attention because it featured celebrities Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis promoting the project and participating in the creation of the comedy series which the $800 NFT would allow holders to access. The token sale generated 3,650 ETH ($8.2 million at the time) for the company, and they received a further $20 million in royalties in transactions where holders sold their NFTs on the secondary market. After the news broke the price for the NFTs rose substantially, possibly because people expect the holders to be able to access part of the settlement, but $1 million seems quite small in the scheme of things. The people who lost out in this situation are those who bought the NFTs at their all time high prices of around 0.3 ETH, they are unlikely to benefit from any financial penalties, and the recent rise in price to 0.05 ETH is little consolation.

Claimants in the ongoing bankruptcy processes of FTX, BlockFi and Genesis have had their details [leaked](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-25/ftx-genesis-blockfi-customer-data-at-risk-in-bankruptcy-hack) by Kroll, a provider of bankruptcy services. A hacker performed a sim swap attack on a Kroll employee and was able to access files with details of all the claimants. This further raises concerns that participants in the claims process for bankrupt crypto companies are being targeted by scammers who attempt to gain access to whatever crypto the claimants might hold off the exchange. The leaked details allow the scammers to produce more convincing materials which reference compromised information, one reported example is offering marks a way to speed the claims process or get a better outcome.

The  Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has [announced](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/07/cftc-goes-after-opyn-other-defi-operations-in-enforcement-sweep/) settlements with three DeFi operations (Opyn, ZeroEx, and Deridex), who it charged with offering illegal derivatives trading. The companies agreed to shutting down these services and paying fines of $100,000 to $250,000 after cooperating with the CFTC's investigations.

The CFTC is [hampering](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/09/22/americans-seemingly-arent-allowed-to-put-this-economic-theory-to-the-test/) the development of prediction markets by objecting to any markets relating to political outcomes. These are explicitly banned in over 10 states but the CFTC has a broader objection in that it does not want to become an "election cop" adjudicating disputes about how the contracts have been operated.

Senator Elizabeth Warren has [gathered](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-bill-us-nine-senators-back-elisabeth-warren) support of 9 other senators for her Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, which would crack down on noncustodial wallets, extend Bank Secrecy Act responsibilities, and other measures to tackle illicit use of crypto. 

Chase bank in the UK, owned by JP Morgan, has [announced](https://www.reuters.com/technology/jpmorgans-uk-bank-chase-ban-crypto-transactions-2023-09-26/) a ban on crypto-related transactions for its customers, who from mid-October will no longer be able to make debit card or bank transfers to crypto companies like exchanges. The reason given was that this is a response to a growing number of scams targeting UK users with a crypto component.

The UK's Online Safety Bill has been [passed](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-online-safety-bill-passed-by-parliament-2023-09-19/) by Parliament and is on track to become law. The legislation will require the UK's regulator Ofcom to produce a code of conduct detailing how providers of online messaging platforms must pro-actively police illegal content on those platforms. One particular aspect which has been [criticised](https://theconversation.com/the-uk-just-passed-an-online-safety-law-that-could-make-people-less-safe-213595) would undermine end to end encryption by requiring service providers to sift through encrypted private content for evidence of illegal activity. Both Signal and WhatsApp have indicated that they would leave the UK market rather than comply with the new rules which would require them to undermine their encryption.
