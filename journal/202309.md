### gominer

_[gominer](https://github.com/decred/gominer) { intro }_

Thes switch to BLAKE3 mining has triggered a refresh of the gominer codebase after almost 3 years of almost no development activity since Feb 2020. The main goal was to allow anyone mine with their GPUs as a quick reaction to the first GPU miners, who did not share their code publicly and began to dominate the hashrate. Besides adding BLAKE3 GPU mining support, effort has been made to automate or document the setup process to address multiple pain points reported by the miners.

BLAKE3 GPU mining:

- Added support for [BLAKE3 GPU mining via OpenCL](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/194). It includes a custom optimized BLAKE3 OpenCL kernel based on midstates for supporting GPUs that work with OpenCL and OpenCL with ADL. "Kernel" is a program written in a specialized [OpenCL kernel language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL#OpenCL_kernel_language) that runs on the GPU. This change also improves discovery of CL devices, randomizes nonces to ensure each device is doing different work, and improves displaying of hashrate values.
  - { _was #194 prepared in advance? It came super fast after GPUs showed up! When first private GPU miners were spotted?_ }
- Added support for [BLAKE3 GPU mining with CUDA](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/195) on Linux. CUDA is an API for high performance computing on GPUs. This implementation uses the kernel from the OpenCL version with necessary changes to compile with the CUDA toolkit. Unlike OpenCL, [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) is proprietary, closed source, and only works on Nvidia cards. 
  - { _Who would use CUDA if OpenCL is faster?_ }
- Added a script and instructions for building the CUDA-enabled version of gominer on [Windows](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/206). Building a Go program with CUDA support is [more complicated](https://github.com/decred/gominer/blob/7e2fb9e40e5568d4c85636c7c7ef1474eb44cf6c/cuda_builder.go#L5) on Windows than on Linux, but the new builder goes to great lengths to automate as much as possible. If a missing dependency or environment configuration is detected, the builder will print human-readable directions how to resolve the issue. [Manual instructions](https://github.com/decred/gominer/blob/7e2fb9e40e5568d4c85636c7c7ef1474eb44cf6c/docs/cuda-manual-windows-build.md) have been made as a fallback in case the automatic builder does not work. This change also removes a dependency on GNU Make in favor of a `go generate` based approach.
- Added support for [CUDA versions older than 10](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/216). This allows to build gominer on more configurations, although performance will be significantly degraded with older CUDA. Installed CUDA toolkit version and GPU architecture will be [detected automatically](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/n/commits/a7076d78a46f9b9d9277fb3f92620ed130d5e7e9) during build to use the best possible GPU features, specifically the fast [funnel shift](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12767113/funnel-shift-what-is-it) intrinsic. { _enhanced by 218 commit 2_ }
- Fixed an issue where [autocalibration](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/218/commits/d3e68cf1e370e94eb50b1e74d5b2446b8e24c4ad) could not release the device and make the actual mining loop fail.

While the OpenCL kernel had to be written quickly it came out quite fast. For example, it achieves 10-12 GH/s on an RTX 3070, close to 12 GH/s reported by [WhatToMine](https://whattomine.com/gpus/48-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070) for IronFish, which also uses BLAKE3. While this is not an accurate comparison without considering the details (size of the hashed data or the number of hashing rounds), it suggest that gominer is now good enough to make GPU mining fairer and accessible to more people.

README updates:

- Switched Windows OpenCL build instructions to [MSYS2](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/196).
- Added OpenCL AMD/Nvidia [build instructions](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/198) for Linux.
- Added [configuration instructions](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/199).
- Added [user-reported hashrates](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/201).

Other changes:

- Improved [shutdown handling](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/207).
- 14 [housekeeping](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/210) and clean up commits including the addition of more linters to prevent poor code from getting in.
- Fixed a [couple](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/204) of [issues](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/205) with the [Stratum](https://braiins.com/stratum-v1) protocol.

### Bison Relay

_[Bison Relay](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay) is a new social media platform with strong protections against censorship, surveillance, and advertising, powered by Decred Lightning Network._

September changes included in v0.1.9 release in both the GUI app and text-based brclient:

- Show the dates of contact [creation and last handshake attempt](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/348).
- Added an [ignore list to automatic unsubscription of idle users](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/349). Users in this list will not be automatically unsubscribed or removed from group chats even if they are idle. By default it includes well-known bots (Oprah and GC bot) but more users can be added using the new config file option `autoremoveignorelist`.

GUI app changes included in v0.1.9 release:

- Implemented first round of [mobile-optimized UI design](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/334). This covers the unlock screen, LN overview, feed posts, mobile drawer/sidebar, chat lists, and new icons. Mobile layouts can be tested by reducing the window width below 500 px.
- Updated mobile design for [direct and group chats](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/343) and added date change indicator.
- Improved [listing of user's posts](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/300). Previously it was just text in the direct chat window, while the new listing will look similar to News Feed and indicate whether posts have been downloaded or not. User menu has been tuned to show "Subscribe to Posts" item if not subscribed and "List Posts" and "Unsubscribe to Posts" items if subscribed.
- Added a button to the Settings page that attempts [reset all old key exchanges](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/345) with stale users. The period of no activity that is considered "stale" is taken from the server.
- Fixed [inability to add LN capacity](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/338) after all LN channels had been closed and the app had been restarted.
- Fixed [new comments indicator](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/342) not disappearing when a post has been viewed, fixed new chat indicator not appearing on new messages.
- Fixed [unnecessary redrawing](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/344) of messages.
- Fixed crash of the [unlock page](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/353) on small (mobile) screens.

brclient changes included in v0.1.9 release:

- Made `/list runningtips` command [return an error](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/347) if no tip attempts are running.
- Fixed issues when interacting with local [Pages and Stores](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/335). `/ln payinvoice` command now understands the `lnpay://` prefix in invoice links. "Order Completed" enhanced to show order details and the validity of the invoice (1 hour). If LN invoice creation fails (for example if the seller does not have enough inbound LN capacity) an on-chain payment address will be created instead as a fallback.

In September the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 8,374 DCR worth $111K at September's average rate of $13.23. 

No Treasury spend transactions were mined in September due to a slip in the admin approval timeframe, but a [treasury spend tx](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/dad857ec261237d51247d4bfae1a1ffb4348c8a7ed8933b2b877e6cac1d75436) spending 8,411 DCR was mined on Oct 1 after being approved with 99.9% Yes votes and 64% turnout. This TSpend covers July and the majority of August's billing, in an effort to close the expanding gap between work being completed and being paid. It has 53 outputs ranging in size from 7 DCR to 1719 DCR. The billing rate for July was $15.40/DCR and for August $13.89/DCR, at the average of $14.65/DCR the payment would cover about $123K of costs for both months combined.

{ _Other interesting facts/stories about the legacy or new treasury._ }

As of Oct 5, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 866,862 DCR (11.4 million USD at $13.20).

Voting was completed for two proposals in September, but the voting period was disrupted by the activation of DCP-0011 and a period of around 2 days where the blockchain was stalled waiting for a new block to be found with the new hashing function, followed by a period of rapid block production as GPU miners began operating on the network. The delay of greater than 24 hours without a block caused certain safeguards to activate in the wallet software, which became convinced that the client must be offline and would have prevented normal voting behavior.  

* The Cryptopower multi asset Golang wallet for Desktop and Mobile [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/256efee) with a budget of $61,600 was approved with 69.6% Yes votes and 62% turnout. 

* The Cake Wallet integration proposal requesting $80,000 to integrate basic DCR functionality in Cake Wallet failed to reach the quorum requirement with 18% turnout, although it was on 87% approval. Cake Wallet voting was authorized and started after the Cryptopower proposal was already voting for more than 1 day, and as a result Cake Wallet suffered much more from the voting system problems.

There were two "new" proposals published this month, although one of them is a repeat of the Cake Wallet integration proposal.

* [Cake Wallet Integration Again](https://proposals.decred.org/record/b3bdacb) is back for another try at the quorum requirement.
* A fifth iteration of Lindseymmc's PR [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/0c04c6f) initially requested an increased amount of $60,000 for another year, then reduced to $48,000.

The debate around Drivechains for Bitcoin and BIP-300 has [reignited](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-bip300-drivechain-proposal-sparks-debate-and-alternate-solutions) after lukedashjr wrote an implementation. There are discussions about whether this kind of sidechain which would allow for flexible creation and use of other assets would be a positive for Bitcoin, whether there are technical downsides or if allowing people to create scam-like assets on Bitcoin is the worst aspect. There are also discussions about how to activate the soft fork, with already some miners [signalling](https://twitter.com/francispouliot_/status/1697633126497882143) support. A new player entered the mix in September with claims of being able to operate a sidechain with a two-way peg on Bitcoin without any soft fork changes, but they as yet had no explanation which people could make sense of.

Paxos [accidentally](https://cointelegraph.com/news/miner-returns-over-500k-btc-transaction-fee-overpayment-paxos) paid 19.8 BTC for a Bitcoin transaction, but F2Pool apparently returned the BTC.

The Brave browser [announced](https://brave.com/web3-privacy/) a partnership with Electronic Coin Company to add Zcash support to its wallet, and to develop a "private and decentralized messaging feature" with the support of Filecoin and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).

Nouns DAO, which auctions off NFTs one per day to fund a treasury and had amassed a sum of around $50 million in this fashion, underwent a [fork](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/21/nouns-daos-27m-revolt-reveals-toxic-mix-of-money-hungry-traders-and-blockchain-idealists/) which saw over half of this value exiting through a newly introduced quit mechanism. The Nouns DAO is controlled by voting of the holders of Noun NFTs, and this community had long been split between a camp which embodied the original spirit of using the fund to promote the Nouns meme, and a camp which was disturbed by frivolous spending like $90,000 on naming a frog species, and which saw themselves as entitled to some share of the fund proportional to the number of Nouns NFTs and voting power they had. As the product of a long running discussion, v3 of the Nouns DAO's contracts incorporated a mechanism that allowed 20% of the NFTs to trigger a weeklong forking discussion and voting period. The majority of Nouns holders chose to exit and their share of the funds is now moved to a new DAO that has a ragequit mechanism, in addition to the familiar mechanisms of Nouns DAO, which will allow them to further exit and claim their individual share of that balance, if they so desire.

Terra Classic is to [cease](https://cointelegraph.com/news/terra-classic-cease-ustc-minting) minting and reminting of USTC in hopes of returning it to parity with the US dollar, after a vote with 59% in favour of the proposal. Since the LUNC price declined there are concerns about spam and a proposal to increase the minimum deposit amount to 5 million LUNC was approved with 93% support. 

Coinbase, in its role as an Ethereum validator, [received](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/15/coinbase-inadvertently-earned-1m-due-to-hack-but-hasnt-reimbursed-victims/) a 570 ETH MEV payment from the Curve hackers in July to prioritise the transactions which allowed them to profit from the attack. That's about $1 million profit for Coinbase at the moment, and they seem reluctant to return it to the damaged party, Alchemix, citing legal opinion that they are under no obligation to do so.

The SEC agreed a settlement in which the makers of the Stoner Cats NTF collection and associated web series were [fined](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/09/14/the-inanity-of-the-sec-stoner-cat-action/) $1 million and had to kill all the Cats in its possession. The case attracted attention because it featured celebrities Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis promoting the project and participating in the creation of the comedy series which the $800 NFT would allow holders to access. The token sale generated 3,650 ETH ($8.2 million at the time) for the company, and they received a further $20 million in royalties in transactions where holders sold their NFTs on the secondary market. After the news broke the price for the NFTs rose substantially, possibly because people expect the holders to be able to access part of the settlement, but $1 million seems quite small in the scheme of things. The people who lost out in this situation are those who bought the NFTs at their all time high prices of around 0.3 ETH, they are unlikely to benefit from any financial penalties, and the recent rise in price to 0.05 ETH is little consolation.

Claimants in the ongoing bankruptcy processes of FTX, BlockFi and Genesis have had their details [leaked](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-25/ftx-genesis-blockfi-customer-data-at-risk-in-bankruptcy-hack) by Kroll, a provider of bankruptcy services. A hacker performed a sim swap attack on a Kroll employee and was able to access files with details of all the claimants. This further raises concerns that participants in the claims process for bankrupt crypto companies are being targeted by scammers who attempt to gain access to whatever crypto the claimants might hold off the exchange. The leaked details allow the scammers to produce more convincing materials which reference compromised information, one reported example is offering marks a way to speed the claims process or get a better outcome.

The  Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has [announced](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/07/cftc-goes-after-opyn-other-defi-operations-in-enforcement-sweep/) settlements with three DeFi operations (Opyn, ZeroEx, and Deridex), who it charged with offering illegal derivatives trading. The companies agreed to shutting down these services and paying fines of $100,000 to $250,000 after cooperating with the CFTC's investigations.

The CFTC is [hampering](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/09/22/americans-seemingly-arent-allowed-to-put-this-economic-theory-to-the-test/) the development of prediction markets by objecting to any markets relating to political outcomes. These are explicitly banned in over 10 states but the CFTC has a broader objection in that it does not want to become an "election cop" adjudicating disputes about how the contracts have been operated.

Senator Elizabeth Warren has [gathered](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-bill-us-nine-senators-back-elisabeth-warren) support of 9 other senators for her Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, which would crack down on noncustodial wallets, extend Bank Secrecy Act responsibilities, and other measures to tackle illicit use of crypto. 

Chase bank in the UK, owned by JP Morgan, has [announced](https://www.reuters.com/technology/jpmorgans-uk-bank-chase-ban-crypto-transactions-2023-09-26/) a ban on crypto-related transactions for its customers, who from mid-October will no longer be able to make debit card or bank transfers to crypto companies like exchanges. The reason given was that this is a response to a growing number of scams targeting UK users with a crypto component.

The UK's Online Safety Bill has been [passed](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-online-safety-bill-passed-by-parliament-2023-09-19/) by Parliament and is on track to become law. The legislation will require the UK's regulator Ofcom to produce a code of conduct detailing how providers of online messaging platforms must pro-actively police illegal content on those platforms. One particular aspect which has been [criticised](https://theconversation.com/the-uk-just-passed-an-online-safety-law-that-could-make-people-less-safe-213595) would undermine end to end encryption by requiring service providers to sift through encrypted private content for evidence of illegal activity. Both Signal and WhatsApp have indicated that they would leave the UK market rather than comply with the new rules which would require them to undermine their encryption.
