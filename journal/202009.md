## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

The decentralize treasury spending [pull request](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2170) is [merged](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/1308125042149134336) to master. It got 576 review comments, changed 115 files, added 15K lines of code, and took 5 months since the first draft was published. Several developers have been pulled from other projects to thoroughly review and test this consensus-critical code. Thanks to everyone for the hard work on this epic change!

DCP0006 describing the upcoming consensus change is under [review](https://github.com/decred/dcps/pull/17).

Follow-up merged treasury work:

- one-way [migration](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2336) of the database to support the new treasury implementation
- [tracking](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2350) of tspend (treasury spend) transactions in the mempool
- new peer messages to [relay](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2349) tspend transactions as nodes startup (this is to help both mining nodes and the voting wallets discover tspends in a timely manner)
- new RPC command to [tally](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2351) the vote count of tspend transactions (initially only tspends in the mempool or that were mined can be queried)
- removed [footguns](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2389) from code for calculating tspend window values
- reworked [consistency](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2394) in the `standalone` package and brought the test coverage back to 100%

Other merged work:

- optimized signature [cache](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2358) to proactively evict entries related to transactions in a block that is already 2 blocks deep
- consolidated ban [disable/whitelist](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2363) logic
- more restrictive systemd service [privileges](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2357)
- updated [checkpoints](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2370) and min known [chain work](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2371) for the upcoming release
- dependency updates to prepare for the release
- lots of smaller improvements in test coverage, logging, error handling, etc

@matheusd wrote a standalone [tool](https://github.com/matheusd/tspend) to generate tspend transactions that can be used on air-gapped setups (without requiring a network connection to an underlying dcrd instance). It can be used in combination with @jrick's [ss](https://github.com/jrick/ss) tool for for post-quantum file and stream encryption.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

- decentralized treasury spending [support](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1714), including a new tool for network operators to generate treasury keys
- [warn](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1822) when dumping extended public keys (if the xpub is leaked in combination with any account private key, this reveals all private keys of the account)
- handle [change](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1830) for unmixed ticket buying
- saving of [unpublished](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1838) transactions to the database (necessary to prevent some previous wallet outputs from being double spent across restarts, or to persist partially signed tx; this will be used by vspd clients)
- new flag to only add tickets [manually](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1833) and not discover them through network sync (this flag will be used by vspd admins to prevent their users getting free votes by reusing their voting address. With this flag set, tickets can only be added to the vspd through the proper API)
- add redeem script for P2SH [listunspent](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1842) results (this is for dcrdex)
- changes to support [vspd](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1840)
- implemented [sendrawtransaction](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1846) method
- extensive testing by vspd and dcrdex clients helped to identify and fix numerous bugs

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton):

- reuse [checkbox](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2663) component from pi-ui
- continued refactoring to functional components and CSS modules
- multiple bug fixes

In progress:

- LN [watchtower](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2638) support
- LN [UI/UX](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2641) improvements

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia):

- added [tests](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1296) for the user database
- optimized memory usage with [pagination](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1306)
- admin TOTP [reset](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1298) command

CMS:

- added user [search](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2131) back
- replaced remaining [cache](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1300) usage to clear the way for tlog migration
- added [LevelDB](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1302) implementation for userdb plugins for CMS (used for testing infrastructire) { is the wording correct? }

In progress:

- [TOTP](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1212) login
- querying user's code [stats](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1185) for CMS admins
- tlog implementation on the [backend](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1180) and the [GUI](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2142)

Status update from @lukebp:

> Most of the politeia developement was focused on tlog this past month. The frontend and backend work to match the existing politeia functionality is complete. The next few weeks are focused on testing tlog, working through bugs, writing documentation, and adding test coverage to the code. The only feature that has yet to be implemented is the ability to retrieve the inclusion proof for a specific piece of politeia data. The politeiad backend currently supports this, but the corresponding politeiawww routes need to be added as well as a way to display/download the inclusion proofs in the GUI. This functionality will be added before launch.

[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd):

- store records of up to 10 vote choice [changes](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/180) for each ticket, for two-way accountability
- require that dcrwallet runs in [manual tickets](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/187) mode

[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool):

- updated the codebase to Go 1.13 [error types](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/245)
- fixed reconnection [error](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/247)

[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd):

- the PR for [porting](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/103) the upstream work has been updated with all work done up to v0.11.1-beta version. That'll bring us on par with the current latest lnd release.

[dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex):

- implemented order history view with filters and infinite scrolling, and order details [view](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/644) with all matches and relevant transaction outputs
- show amounts [locked](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/683) in contracts and update balances in more cases
- added [`match_status`](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/643) and [`order_status`](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/687) routes to recover from unusual cases discovered in testing, like laptops suspending or poor connectivity causing clients to miss the `revoke_match` step (restarting the dexc program fixed it but it was poor UX)
- improved [reconnection](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/663) handling
- more robust handling of [missing](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/661) matches { is this a good translation to en? }
- return [active orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/677) on `connect` response
- [unlock](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/648) coins in more cases when no longer needed (read [this](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/648#issuecomment-688585289) random comment to get a taste of how many cases must be considered in a trustless swap protocol)
- [notify](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/649) user of penalty
- grace period for new users when [cancellation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/638) rate threshold is not enforced
- auto-find [redemption](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/513) when Maker goes dark after Taker swap { what "auto-find" means? }
- multiple [inaction](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/680) check fixes { what is "inaction"? is it notable or mostly internal? }
- require [password](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/621) for client RPC
- opt-in debug [logging](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/654) in the UI
- many internal changes and bug fixes

A total of 35 PRs from 4 contributors were [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2020-09-01..2020-09-30+sort%3Aupdated-asc), adding 9K and deleting 2.6K lines of code.

> Since decentralization is a founding principle of the crypto-space it gets a lot of lip-service but one of the oldest problems with power is that it is extremely rare that once someone has it, they will give it up voluntarily. Decred is a rare exception and notable in the progress its developers have made in converting the projects resources into this autonomous system. Monero is another outlier here, as its development is completely funded by community donations.

Bitcoin Cash's current situation was [summarised](https://read.cash/@Cain/the-current-bch-drama-for-outsiders-50b4dbb8) nicely by Cain. The BCH (aka BCH ABC) chain looks set to fork over a dispute about developer funding. The Bitcoin ABC developers are adding a rule from Nov 15 that 8% of the block reward must go to an address controlled by them, to fund infrastructure development. This idea has been controversial in the BCH community for some time, and an alternative BCHN implementation is planned. This sets up an interesting hash war scenario, where ABC miners will not mine on BCHN blocks without a developers' reward, whereas the BCHN miners will mine on anything - if the BCHN chain does not have a significant majority of hashpower, BCHN miners would be likely to see a lot of orphaned blocks. BCH has a checkpointing system, which adds some further intrigue around the possibility of chain splits and new nodes ending up on different chains. So far around 50% of PoW mining power is signalling for BCHN, and the rest is not signalling for anything. 

Bitshares has a [forthcoming](https://finbold.com/binance-huobi-announces-support-for-upcoming-bitshares-hardfork/) hardfork which is being supported by Binance and Huobi, after the Bitshares China Association alleged that one of the Bitshares developers had tampered with voting system code without community approval.

The Polkadot Treasury received its first [proposals](https://polkadot.network/writing-history-the-first-teams-submit-their-proposal-to-the-polkadot-treasury-2/). Polkadot's Treasury is funded by transaction fees, slashing and staking inefficiencies - and every 24 days if these funds are not used 1% of the balance is burned. The funds are presently administered by the Polkadot Council, and the first four teams to be funded this way are working on a development environment for pallet-contracts, a Go Substrate RPC Client, Polkascan, and a platform for local community currencies and self-issued universal basic income.
