## { Some Announcement }

{ _Add individual sections for high-impact announcements, such as consensus votes, software releases, milestones, major bugs, etc._ }


## DCRDEX v0.5.9 Release

v0.5.9 was released with v0.6 just around the corner to enable automatically deployed Docker images for Umbrel. However, there are many other fixes in this release that were backported from v0.6 development:

- Improved client database compaction to save disk space.
- More accurate swap fee estimates.
- Zero fee swaps are prevented.
- Improved performance.
- Cleaned up logging.
- Fixed about a dozen of edge cases.

Full release notes and standalone DEX app downloads can be found [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases). Hashes and signatures files are included that allow to [verify](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/verifying-binaries) the downloads have not been damaged or modified by third parties.


## Bison Relay v0.1.4 Release

{ highlights, links }


## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover its most notable dev work._
- _For each project, the order of reporting is "most released first": changes released to end users, merged to master, in progress (work started), discussions and future plans._
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

}


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commits/master }

Multi:

- Now uses new [atomic types](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3053) in unexported modules thanks to go 1.19.  This makes the code less prone to human error and a bit less verbose.
- Added a forced deployment result [network parameter](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3060) to specify a vote choice that should always be considered as having been the majority result of a vote and updates the relevant logic in blockchain accordingly to respect it. (will come back to explain this bette)

Connection Manager:

- Updated the [atomic connection](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3055) request ID field. This adds additional synchronization logic to the code that conditionally updates the ID of an existing connection request when one hasn't already been assigned to help prevent any potential logic races that could inadvertently be introduced in future code updates.

docker:

- Added the ability to build [versioned docker images](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3048).
- Added another 'RUN' command to the docker image to display the [dcrctl version output](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3062) in addition to the dcrd version.

Chain-Config:

- Reworked the [deployment validation logic](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3056) that runs at initialization time to make it easier to modify and bring it more in line with the more modern coding practices used in the codebase.
- Reworked the [deployment validation tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3056) to make them more consistent with modern practices in the code as well as to simplify them and make them more flexible by moving the primary logic for all of the expected results into the test definitions themselves.
- Now enforces [globally unique vote IDs](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3057) for different agendas.

Blockchain:

- Simplified the [threshold state determination](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3059) for various deployments.
- Removed unused [database update tracking](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3065).


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commits/master }

- Made improvements to the [address locking](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2204) order to prevent deadlock when using the DEX.
- [Updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2206) the 'addrmgr' (address manager?) module which provides performance improvements under SPV mode when few quality peers are available to return.
- Bumped remaining [golang.org modules](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2209).


### dcrctl

_[dcrctl](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl) is a command-line client for dcrd and dcrwallet._

{ _Hint: dcrctl is pulling most of the code from dcrd and dcrwallet. Often there is not much to report and this section can be removed._ }

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/commits/master }

- Updated [dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/pull/54) to latest modules.


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/decrediton/commits/master }

In Progress:

- [Update to React v18.](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3851)


### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software for running a Voting Service Provider. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/vspd/commits/master }

- Improvements to [VSP closed checks](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/369) so that they occur before dcrd/dcrwallet/database clients are initialized, preventing possible errors.
- Tests are now run as [sub-tests](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/365) to enable better reporting of test results and metrics.
- Added tests for [error handling](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/363) in the client that ensure vspd errors are correctly wrapped as 'types.ErrorResponse', and non-vspd errors contain adequate information for debugging.
- Removed [dcrstakepool instructions](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/370) from documentation as it is now defunct.
- Fixes to [config log levels](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/371).


### cspp

_[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp) is a server for coordinating coin mixes using the CoinShuffle++ protocol. It is non-custodial, i.e. does not hold any funds._

{ _Check_ https://github.com/decred/cspp/commits/master }

- Added a [csppsolver command](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/86) and solverrpc package. This will allow pure-Go processes to run a solver built with cgo. (?)


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

The [v0.5.9 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.5.9) was [motivated](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2153) by a need to have a Git tag with the new Docker build actions for Umbrel, but it also includes many important fixes made since around December 2022.

Changes made in `master` and backported to v0.5.9 release:

- [Updated Docker config](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2112): optimized base images, switched DEX client to run as non-root user, and excluded unneeded files. Among other things it helps to integrate the DEX client [into Umbrel](https://proposals.decred.org/record/8d83046). { _plus a fix in 2154_ }
- Removed some unneeded [logging](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/108a81e89b45b3f1941f9b86dc1996b03596cddf). { _minor_ }
- Updated test code to [stop using `rand.Seed`](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/15998d6bac324da31b77bee79d743beb991110cd) which was deprecated in Go 1.20. { _minor_ }
- Updated [GitHub CI](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2100) to build with Go 1.19 and Go 1.20, dropping Go 1.18. { _minor_ }
- Added GitHub workflow to build and publish [release Docker images](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2127).
- Updated dcrd's [address manager](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2096) module to fix high CPU use when running testnet SPV wallet for longer than a day.
- Updated [dcrwallet module](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2109) to fix a deadlock. { _minor_ }
- Updated [Go](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2145) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/28063b2d133a031bd538652d84d56b747d1c6cd8) dependencies for security fixes. { _minor_ }
- Adjusted which [swap fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2147) are considered "best" for BTC and DCR. The best case fees occur when the entire order is consumed in a single match, i.e. 1 transaction and 1 output for the entire order. This affects fee previews shown when placing an order.
- Ignore very [old notifications](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2144) generated by old client versions.
- Optimized [Docker build](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2162) for production.
- Fixed the number of [orders and matches](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2098) that was deleted by archive cleanup functions.
- Fixed useless [reconnect attempts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2130) when a "not standards compliant" certificate error is detected on some macOS systems.
- Fixed [extra spaces](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2148) in server URLs failing to parse. { _minor_ }
- Fixed client trying to run when [accounts database](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2119) failed to load.
- Backported [~14 other fixes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2153) from `master` made in December-January. { _ef84b8e to fa877c2, inclusive_ }

All other changes below are in the `master` branch towards the next [v0.6 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/milestone/22).

Client changes:

- Made more strings [translatable](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2065) { _minor_ }
- Handle more edge cases during [server certificate change](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2019).
- Hide [order form](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2054) if asset version is not supported.
- Show [fees as a percentage](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2110) of the order for token assets, if fiat rates are available for both the token and its parent asset.
- Made whole order row [clickable](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2117) to expand it. { _minor_ }
- Allow to connect to a DEX server [in view-only mode](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1986) (without registration), browse markets and see order books.

Client, fidelity bonds progress:

- Implemented main [bond lifecycle](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2036) machinery for the client, including automatic bond rotation. When current bond is about to expire, it must be replaced by another bond at correct time to continue using the DEX without interruption. A [diagram](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/blob/7603ead02dc6e040e69b50f8796e3f23aac06e1b/client/core/bond.go#L49) was added to explain the rather complex lifecycle of bonds.
- Implemented maintenance of [bond funds reserves](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2103). A portion of wallet's funds will be reserved for future bonds plus a buffer for transaction fees. When reserves are enforced, transactions like wallet withdraws or trading orders will be restricted to a lower available balance. Wallet balance report will show funds locked in existing bonds and reserved for future bonds. Bonds will use coin selection strategy that is different from one that funds trading orders. Orders try to consume few outputs to minimize fees, while bonds try to minimize the amount of DCR locked. Pre-sizing of inputs for swap transactions was enabled by default for DCR because it benefits bond management and DCR fees are cheap now. It will not be possible to disable accounts that have unspent bonds. Initial implementation supports only DCR bonds but the foundations have been added to allow bonds in other assets.
- Changed registration UI flow to [create a bond](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2025) instead of paying a fee. User will have a choice how strong the bond should be. If account tier is below the trading level and there are pending bonds, Markets page will show confirmation counter for pending bonds. Post Bond feature was added to Settings page for manual bond posting.
- Optimized DCR [coin selection](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2169) algorithm to find a set of outputs having total DCR closer to the target amount.
- Completed, in progress and remaining tasks for the bonds subsystem can be seen on [this dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/decred/projects/2/views/1).
- In the big picture, [fidelity bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_bond) are needed to transition from users *paying fees* to the server, to users *locking funds* while they use the server. Both approaches protect the server from spam and other undesired behavior. Bonds are more complex than fees but have advantages. Users can return locked funds when they no longer want to trade, and also bonds support the transition from standalone servers to a decentralized [server mesh](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1765) (with the fees system it would be unclear which servers should collect fees).

Client fixes: { _join too small/uninteresting fixes in groups_ }

- ~{ 2116 } UI fixes.
- Fixed { 2097 2092 2132 2178 } concurrency bugs.
- Fixed creating [token wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2121) when the parent wallet has not yet been created.
- Fixed [order status](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2140) discrepance on different views.
- Fixed confusing [sync progress](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2133) reporting on Register page.
- Fixed repeated re-fetching of [asset icons](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2163).
- Fixed failure to withdraw [all available DCR](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2170) from the wallet.
- Fixed [cursor and sort direction](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2172) on the recent matches table.
- Fixed [missing explorer links](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2181) for funding coins on order details page.
- Fixed [wallet balance](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2183) not getting updated after funding an order.

Other changes:

- Improved [test logs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2063) to better explain what is happening.
- Added [miner nodes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2150) to test harnesses. { _cryptic, group_ }
- Use [Docker login](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2167) action and made `apt-get` non-interactive. { _cryptic, group_ }
- Added [database upgrade](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2166) logic to correct archived match status. { _minor_ }
- Fixed { 2108 2131 } flaky tests { _minor_ }
- Fixed docs { 2107 } { _minor_ }
- Server fixes { 2149 }

Ethereum:

- Added ability for the DEX server to use [multiple Ethereum data providers](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2104) and switch to another provider if the current one does not serve needed data.
- Simplified handling of [best known block](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2105). { _minor_ }
- Clarified API [versioning](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2094) of ETH and its child token assets. For now token assets will use the same version as the parent asset. These version numbers will be used to determine if different clients and servers and their components are compatible. { _did not fully grasp what these versions control and added a general explainer. Also it is minor and free to group._ }
- Removed the [`isRedeemable` method](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2111) from Solidity smart contracts for ETH and ERC-20 swaps, and disabled the use of `estimateRedeemGas` call. Both methods reveal a secret to the Ethereum node ahead of the redeem transaction. This was not a problem when the client was using a private node, but it becomes a vulnerability with public RPC providers, which DEX is forced to use since The Merge. Solidity compiler was updated to v0.8.18.
- Added monitoring of [RPC provider health](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2125). Previously, ETH backend would only start if all configured providers could be connected to and had an updated blockchain. Now ETH backend will start if at least one provider connection works and reports a fresh block. After connection is established providers will be continuously monitored for healthy responses and the best providers will be used first.
- Made [swap estimates](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2129) aware of Ethereum block gas limit.
- Attempt to use a lower gas limit for [batched swaps](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2143) (multiple swaps in one transaction) before failing for having low reserved funds.
- Adjusted [fee estimate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2139) to a lower and more realistic amount.
- Improved management of [known and compliant RPC providers](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2102).
- Build with `go-ethereum` code [by default](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2157). There is now a `nolgpl` build flag to build DEX without Ethereum code, which is licensed as GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). The burden of this license may be unacceptable for closed source software.
- Create wallet dir if it does not exist and [log less details](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2159) for RPC provider checks.
- Enabled ETH and USDC on [mainnet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2013). Adjusted gas limits for latest observation. Reduced redeem transaction confirmations from 10 to 3 since reorgs are [considered](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/5c1ff8ab05a43b431f6d8e091692c32ea181e937) very unlikely after The Merge. Smart contract enthusiasts can find swap contract for for ETH [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8c17e4968b6903e1601be82ca989c5b5e2c7b400#code), for ERC-20 [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1bbd020ddd6dc01f974aa74d2d727b2a6782f32d#code).
- Fixed new block headers not being detected over [WebSockets](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2091).
- Fixed attempts to handle [tip change](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2138) event for unconnected token wallets.
- Fixed attempts to use RPC providers that serve [too old block headers](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2074) (i.e. are not synced with the network).

Ethereum's ["The Merge"](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/) upgrade to proof-of-stake consensus had a side effect of [bricking light clients](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/25623), while they were [expected](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/24/finalized-no-24) to be supported. This has delayed DCRDEX v0.6 quite a bit as a workaround had to be developed. Until [light clients](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/les) are fixed DEX users will have a choice of running a full node or using centralized chain data providers like [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/), and [8 others](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/blob/80b0531a64a806ac8901d812b1e322418118cac1/client/asset/eth/multirpc.go).

## Governance

{ _Hint: Currently this is a mix of finances and governance. We may add the separate Finances section in the future._ }

In February the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 7,620 DCR worth $183K at February's average rate of $24.03. 3,389 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $81K at February's rate, or $75K at January's billing rate of $22.05. 

The [treasury spend tx](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/tx/e09505dbb877e5efdd184129858be5655a3de235cdac2cfa749442f0ccf7de81) had 27 outputs making payments to contractors, ranging from 3 DCR to 1,084 DCR. Most of this DCR was likely paid for December invoices, there is now a persistent lag between the end of the month and the creation of the Tspend for that month, so that by the time transactions are approved by stakeholders it is typically two months after the month when work was conducted.

{ _Other interesting facts/stories about the legacy or new treasury._ }

As of Mar 14, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 844,504 DCR (16.8 million USD at $19.88).

There were no new proposals published in Feb, and the proposals which finished voting in the month were covered in the January issue of the Journal.

{ _Check https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/commits/master for updates._ }

See Politeia Digest [issue {}]({}) for more details on the month's proposals.


## Network

{ _Hint: "Network" tracks key "health" metrics of the fundamental infrastructure._ }

{ _Hint: n, n.n, and n.nn tell how many decimals to keep, e.g. 100, 16.5, 8.63_ }

**Hashrate**: February's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of {} Ph/s hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

{ _Hint: Fallback links for pool distribution: https://poolbay.io/crypto/54/decred , https://dcrstats.com/pow ._ }

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

Localbitcoins, the longstanding facilitator of person to person Bitcoin exchanges, is [closing down](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/02/09/bitcoin-exchange-localbitcoins-to-close-citing-market-conditions/). After 10 years in action Localbitcoins could not withstand the "ongoing very cold crypto winter", and suspended trading on Feb 16, remaining online only for users to withdraw any balances.

Crypto exchange Kraken has [settled](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-25) with the SEC over "Unregistered Offer and Sale of Crypto Asset Staking-As-A-Service Program" and agreed to "Pay $30 Million to Settle SEC Charges". This has been presented as part of a larger [crackdown](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-is-cracking-down-on-crypto-staking-heres-what-to-know-f0922151) on exchange provided staking services, where exchanges generate revenue by staking users' tokens and pay some proportion of this to the token holders. The stated motivation for these actions is to provide investors with reliable information about what custodians of their tokens are using them for, but as Kraken CEO Jesse Powell has [tweeted](https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1624177588074848256), this is not as easy as filling in a form, and for companies that have tried to engage with the approval process it has [not gone well](https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1626609794260803584).

The Oasis DeFi protocol was used to "[counter-exploit](https://www.blockworksresearch.com/research/we-do-a-little-counter-exploit)" the hacker who stole 120,000 ETH from the Wormhole bridge in Feb 2022 and steal back funds they had deposited in the platform, after its developers were [ordered](https://blog.oasis.app/statement-regarding-the-transactions-from-the-oasis-multisig-on-21st-feb-2023/) to by a British High Court. After the Wormhole Bridge was exploited last year, Jump Crypto (its VC backer) stepped in to make users whole and has since been tracking the stolen funds with a view to retrieval. As [reported](https://blockworks.co/news/jump-crypto-wormhole-hack-recovery) by Blockworks, Jump Crypto likely played a key role in the retrieval, they provided funds to reclaim the collatoral and close open positions and it is likely they are also the "Whitehat group" referenced in the Oasis blog post who provided a proof of concept on how the assets could be retrieved. The counter-exploit involved an upgradeable contract and adding a new signer to the 4-of-12 multisig that owns the Oasis contracts. It is not clear what the process was to generate the court order to perform the exploit.

Facebook parent Meta [reported](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/02/01/facebook-parent-metas-metaverse-division-lost-137b-in-2022/) losses of $13.7 Billion in its Metaverse Division for 2022, and warned that the losses would accelerate further in 2023.



Optimism, a layer 2 Etherem chain, [performed](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/lPZEkFF7LU2ZlrO-dsV3p_LtWQUaknFGfxFMgSz3vGA) its second airdrop, sending 11.7 million OP tokens to over 300,000 addresses. This airdrop rewarded users who delegated their OP for governance, and users who spent more than $6 on gas fees, along with multipliers for delegating more for longer or using more gas. Optimism is committed to distributing 19% of its supply in airdrops, and the first one in May 2022 distributed 5%.
