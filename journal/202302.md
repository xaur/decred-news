## DCRDEX v0.5.9 Release

v0.5.9 was released with v0.6 just around the corner to enable automatically deployed Docker images for Umbrel. However, there are many other fixes in this release that were backported from v0.6 development:

- Improved client database compaction to save disk space.
- More accurate swap fee estimates.
- Protections against zero fee swaps.
- Improved performance.
- Cleaned up logging.
- Fixed about a dozen of edge cases.

Full release notes and standalone DEX app downloads can be found [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases). Hashes and signatures are included that allow to [verify](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/verifying-binaries) the downloads have not been damaged or modified by third parties.


## Bison Relay v0.1.4 Release

Bison Relay received another quality of life update with v0.1.4:

- Everything works faster.
- Adjustable font size.
- Image and link attachments.
- Tipping bot that rewards authors of valuable content.
- Right-side panel for easier access to actions on users and group chats.
- More robust key exchange maintenance.
- Many other UX improvements.

Short video overview of new features is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yz-IPu00eDc).

## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Most changes focused on making consensus deployment code more robust and easier to understand:

- Reworked [consensus deployment](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3056) validation logic and tests to make it easier to modify and bring it more in line with the more modern coding practices used in the codebase. Terms "deployment" and "agenda" refer to [consensus vote definitions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/974b1b3ccc7393c5450d75f1f58b75b80020cc3b/chaincfg/mainnetparams.go#L139) that include description, vote choices, validity period, and other details.
- Enforce [globally unique vote IDs](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3057) for different agendas. Technically it was not incorrect to reuse vote IDs, however various software in the Decred ecosystem implicitly assumes that IDs are unique across all agendas. This unwritten rule is now formalized to prevent confusion and simplify code dealing with it.
- Simplified code that tracks the status [consensus rule changes](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3059).
- Added a network parameter to [force consensus votes](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3060) to certain outcomes and activate their features accordingly. This has already been used on testing networks to quickly test features without going through an entire voting process. The way it worked though was found to be surprising behavior: "if deployment is not found in parameters for a given network, it is considered active". Other issues included complexity of testing the voting process itself, and such implicitly forced votes being invisible in commands like `getblockchaininfo`. All these issues were fixed and it is now easier to locate forced rules in the code. A safety check was also added to ensure the forced vote choices cannot be used on the main network.

Docker:

- Added the ability to build [Docker images](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3048) for a specific Git version.
- Print the [dcrctl version](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3062) in addition to the dcrd version since they come from separate repositories now.

Other:

- Switch to new [atomic types](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3053) in unexported modules thanks to Go 1.19. This makes the code less prone to human error and a bit less verbose. Exported modules are upgraded in a [separate PR](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3054) which will be merged later to [not force the consumers](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3054#issuecomment-1428189607) to newer Go versions too soon.
- Updated [connection request](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3055) tracking to prevent concurrency bugs.
- Fixed building on OpenBSD on [riscv64](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3049) CPU architecture.
- Updated build infra and docs for [Go 1.20](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3052) and dropped support for Go 1.18.
- Dependency updates.


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

- Fixed a deadlock in [address discovery](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2204) that could be triggered by poorly timed `getnewaddress` command.
- Updated the [`addrmgr` module](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2206) from dcrd for performance improvements under SPV mode when few quality peers are available.
- Updated [golang.org/x modules](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2209), including newer `x/sys` to support building on [OpenBSD](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2208) running on riscv64 CPU.


### dcrctl

_[dcrctl](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl) is a command-line client for dcrd and dcrwallet._

- Updated [dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/pull/54) to latest modules. This allows building on OpenBSD riscv64 and also significantly reduces the indirect dependencies.


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

In progress:

- [Update to React v18](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3851). It may require big changes but should bring performance improvements.


### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software for running a Voting Service Provider. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

- Check if the [VSP is closed](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/369) much earlier, before dcrd/dcrwallet/database clients are initialized. This is more efficient and prevents possible errors.
- Updated to [Go 1.20](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/368).
- Tests are now run as [sub-tests](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/365) to enable better reporting of test results and metrics.
- Added tests for [error handling](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/363) that ensure vspd errors are correctly formatted, and non-vspd errors contain adequate information for debugging.
- Removed [dcrstakepool instructions](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/370) from documentation as it is now defunct.


### cspp

_[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp) is a server for coordinating coin mixes using the CoinShuffle++ protocol. It is non-custodial, i.e. does not hold any funds._

- Updated CI to build on Ubuntu 22 with latest [flint2](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/69) math [library](http://www.flintlib.org/).
- Added a [`solverrpc` package](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/86) as a drop-in replacement for existing `solver`. It allows to extract the interaction with C code (the flint2 math library) into a separate background process called `csppsolver` and talk to that process from pure Go code, which is more flexible.
- Added [build flags](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/87) that allow to build an entirely standalone `csppsolver` executable with flint2 library embedded in it. Distributing such executable removes the need to install flint2.


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

The [v0.5.9 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.5.9) was [motivated](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2153) by a need to have a Git tag with the new Docker build actions for Umbrel, but it also includes many important fixes made since around December 2022.

Changes made in `master` and backported to v0.5.9 release:

- Adjusted which [swap fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2147) are considered "best" for BTC and DCR. The best case fees occur when the entire order is consumed in a single match, i.e. 1 transaction and 1 output for the entire order. This affects fee previews shown when placing an order.
- Automatically ignore very [old notifications](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2144) generated by old client versions.
- [Updated Docker config](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2112): optimized base images, switched DEX client to run as non-root user, removed unneeded files, and optimized [Docker build](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2162) for production. Among other things it helps to integrate the DEX client [into Umbrel](https://proposals.decred.org/record/8d83046).
- Added GitHub workflow to build and publish [release Docker images](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2127).
- Updated dcrd's [address manager](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2096) module to fix high CPU use when running testnet SPV wallet for longer than a day.
- Fixed the number of [orders and matches](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2098) that was reported by archive cleanup functions.
- Fixed useless [reconnect attempts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2130) when a "not standards compliant" certificate error is detected on some macOS systems.
- Fixed client trying to run when [accounts database](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2119) failed to load.
- Dependency updates, including minor security fixes.
- Backported [~14 other fixes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2153) from `master` made in December-January.

All other changes below are in the `master` branch towards the next [v0.6 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/milestone/22).

Client changes:

- Handle more edge cases when [server certificate changes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2019).
- Hide [order form](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2054) if asset version is not supported.
- Show [fees as a percentage](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2110) of the order for token assets, if fiat rates are available for both the token and its parent asset.
- Allow to connect to a DEX server [in view-only mode](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1986) (without registration), browse markets and see order books.

Client, fidelity bonds progress:

- Implemented main [bond lifecycle](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2036) machinery for the client, including automatic bond rotation. When current bond is about to expire, it must be replaced by another bond at correct time to continue using the DEX without interruption. A [diagram](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/blob/7603ead02dc6e040e69b50f8796e3f23aac06e1b/client/core/bond.go#L49) was added to explain the rather complex lifecycle of bonds.
- Implemented maintenance of [bond funds reserves](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2103). A portion of wallet's funds will be reserved for future bonds plus a buffer for transaction fees. When reserves are enforced, transactions like wallet withdraws or trading orders will be restricted to a lower available balance. Wallet balance report will show funds locked in existing bonds and reserved for future bonds. Bonds will use coin selection strategy that is different from one that funds trading orders. Orders try to consume fewer outputs to minimize fees (can use more DCR and return excess as change), while bonds try to put an exact DCR amount into the time lock (and cannot rely on change output). Pre-sizing of inputs for swap transactions was enabled by default for DCR because it benefits bond management and DCR fees are cheap now. It will not be possible to disable accounts that have unspent bonds. Initial implementation supports only DCR bonds but the foundations have been added to allow bonds in other assets.
- Changed registration UI flow to [create a bond](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2025) instead of paying a fee. User will have a choice how strong the bond should be. If account tier is below the trading level and there are pending bonds, Markets page will show confirmation counter for pending bonds. Post Bond feature was added to Settings page for manual bond posting.
- Optimized DCR [coin selection](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2169) algorithm to find a set of outputs having total DCR closer to the target amount.
- Completed, in progress and remaining tasks for the bonds subsystem can be seen on [this dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/decred/projects/2/views/1).
- In the big picture, [fidelity bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_bond) are needed to transition from users *paying fees* to the server, to users *locking funds* while they use the server. Both approaches protect the server from spam and other undesired behavior. Bonds are more complex than fees but have advantages. Users can return locked funds when they no longer want to trade, and also bonds support the transition from standalone servers to a decentralized [server mesh](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1765) (with the fees system it would be unclear which servers should collect fees).

Client fixes:

- Fixed creating [token wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2121) when the parent wallet has not yet been created.
- Fixed [order status](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2140) discrepancy on different views.
- Fixed confusing [sync progress](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2133) reporting on Register page.
- Fixed repeated re-fetching of [asset icons](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2163).
- Fixed failure to withdraw [all available DCR](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2170) from the wallet.
- Fixed [cursor and sort direction](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2172) on the recent matches table.
- Fixed [wallet balance](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2183) not getting updated after funding an order.
- Fixed ~4 concurrency bugs.
- Other fixes for UI, tests, documentation, and Docker image optimizations.

Ethereum, RPC data providers:

- Added ability for the DEX server to configure [multiple Ethereum data providers](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2104) and switch to another provider if the current one does not serve needed data.
- Added monitoring of [RPC provider health](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2125). Previously, ETH backend would only start if all configured providers could be connected to and had an updated blockchain. Now ETH backend will start if at least one provider connection works and reports a fresh block. After connection is established providers will be continuously monitored for healthy responses and the best providers will be used first.
- Improved management of [known and compliant RPC providers](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2102).
- Fixed attempts to use RPC providers that serve [too old block headers](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2074) (i.e. are not synced with the network).

Ethereum, swap fee optimization:

- Made [swap estimates](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2129) aware of Ethereum block gas limit.
- Attempt to use a lower gas limit for [batched swaps](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2143) (multiple swaps in one transaction) before failing for having low reserved funds.
- Adjusted [fee estimate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2139) to lower and more realistic amounts.

Ethereum, other changes:

- Clarified API [versioning](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2094) of ETH and its child token assets. For now token assets will use the same version as the parent asset. These version numbers will be used to determine if different clients and servers and their components are compatible.
- Removed the [`isRedeemable` method](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2111) from Solidity smart contracts for ETH and ERC-20 swaps, and disabled the use of `estimateRedeemGas` call. Both methods reveal a secret to the Ethereum node ahead of the redeem transaction. This was not a problem when the client was using a private node, but it becomes a vulnerability with public RPC providers, which DEX is forced to use since The Merge. Solidity compiler was updated to v0.8.18.
- Build with [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) code [by default](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2157). go-ethereum is popular Ethereum software that powers ETH and ERC-20 support in DCRDEX. Unlike the DEX, it is licensed as GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). The burden of this license may be unacceptable for closed source software willing to use DCRDEX and so a flag was added to exclude go-ethereum from the build.
- Enabled ETH and USDC on [mainnet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2013). Adjusted gas limits for latest observation. Reduced redeem transaction confirmations from 10 to 3 since reorgs are [considered](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/5c1ff8ab05a43b431f6d8e091692c32ea181e937) very unlikely after The Merge. Smart contract enthusiasts can find swap contract for for ETH [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8c17e4968b6903e1601be82ca989c5b5e2c7b400#code), for ERC-20 [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1bbd020ddd6dc01f974aa74d2d727b2a6782f32d#code).
- @chappjc [tweeted](https://twitter.com/chappjc/status/1623136803661266947) that new contracts executed many atomic swaps with ETH and USDC on mainnet.
- Fixed new block headers not being detected over [WebSockets](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2091).
- Fixed attempts to handle [tip change](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2138) event for unconnected token wallets.

Ethereum's upgrade to proof-of-stake consensus (also called [The Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/)) happened to [brick the light client](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/25623) used by DCRDEX despite some [expectations](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/24/finalized-no-24) it will be supported. This has delayed DCRDEX v0.6 quite a bit while a workaround had to be developed. Until [light clients](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/les) are fixed DEX users will have a choice of running a full node or using centralized chain data providers like [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/), and [8 others](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/blob/80b0531a64a806ac8901d812b1e322418118cac1/client/asset/eth/multirpc.go).

Umbrel app store integration:

- New repository added to Decred GitHub organization for hosting [Umbrel integration](https://github.com/decred/umbrel-app-store) code. Umbrel users can follow the instructions to add the repository and install the DCRDEX package.
- DCRDEX package was submitted to [official Umrel app store](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-apps/pull/430) for review. Unlike custom Community app stores it requires centralized approval.


### Timestamply

_[Timestamply](https://github.com/decred/dcrtimegui) is a free service for timestamping files powered by Decred blockchain. A timestamp proves that a certain file has existed at a certain moment of time. This has a range of applications in protecting data integrity._

- Full site [redesign](https://github.com/decred/dcrtimegui/pull/151) announced in [January](202301.md#timestamply) has been finalized and deployed at [timestamp.decred.org](https://timestamp.decred.org/). All existing data has been [migrated](https://proposals.decred.org/record/855a506/comments/20).
- Added an API method that returns [last digests](https://github.com/decred/dcrtime/pull/84) timestamped by the dcrtime server. It is used by the new GUI.
- Upgraded to [Node v16](https://github.com/decred/dcrtimegui/pull/152).


### Documentation

_[dcrdocs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs) is the source code for Decred [user documentation](https://docs.decred.org/)._

- Updated to [MkDocs Material v9](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1214), including improvements to search.
- Removed [Font Awesome](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1216) icons due to them not working and only appearing on a few pages.


### Bison Relay

_[Bison Relay](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay) is a new peer-to-peer social media platform with strong protections against censorship, surveillance, and advertising, powered by Decred Lightning Network._

Common changes GUI and CLI apps in v0.1.4 release:

- Added support for paying and sending [multiple messages in parallel](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/98) without waiting for server ack.
- Added support for [sending and rendering of embeds](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/118) (images, other attachments, and download links) in private and group chats.
- Tracking of encryption status and [key exchange (KX) resets](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/116) were made easier. Added semi-automatic tools to detect and reset possibly broken key exchanges. Candidates for reset are users from which no messages have been received for a long time, or all users if own client has been offline for a long time.
- Improved handling of new group chat messages received just [after connecting](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/130) to the server. This should properly order messages by time, especially on slower connections.
- Fixed a bug that prevented [clean shutdown](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/commit/ec5637968937439eb8752aa41200947051b2f8c0) in some cases.
- Fixed a possibility of client trying to [reuse message payment](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/131), leading to connection loops.

GUI app changes in v0.1.4:

- Added [font size setting](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/117) with 4 size choices.
- Moved menu actions on users and group chats (List Posts, Pay Tip, etc.) to the [right-side panel](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/119). This is similar to Element and easier to use.
- Order of chat lists is [saved](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/111) across app restarts.
- Use [emoji font](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/commit/41fd091af874512d7a3d941f094c1615e54ee70b) to render more characters and emojis.

Command-line app changes in v0.1.4:

- Removed Ctrl+C as a quit shortcut.
- Removed [auto-scroll to bottom](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/commit/9324add82f4f7bd5317a31f14c8f78618e79e856) if the view was not at the bottom to begin with.
- Alert current window of [completed download](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/commit/fdad19d95a140125019daa5bbb929ed6892df2f2).
- Added [unread message marker](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/commit/e03164fcdf3c168cb772bde17310a003de8418f6) to inactive windows.
- Other fixes and dependency updates.

Server and other changes in v0.1.4:

- Added support for accepting multiple messages [concurrently](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/97), which makes sending much faster. By default a connected client can request up to 8 invoices for message sending before needing to pay for them. Server must detect the payment within 24 hours, otherwise a new payment will be required. Production server may use other config values for this.
- [Store received messages](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/110) so that `clientrpc` users may retrieve them. This prevents missed messages in bots and other automation tools.

Common changes GUI and CLI apps merged in `master` towards the next release (v0.1.5):

- Added a [warning](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/139) alerting the user of LN invoice generation failure and suggesting to increase receive capacity.
- Added [versioning of group chats](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/140) and a warning of an unsupported group chat version.
- Added a command to [resend group chat info](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/commit/dc63dafcad9dad4e1db105418e642ea50349896f) to its members to fix issues with the user list getting out of sync.
- Fixed [group chat message ordering](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/136) after app restart.

GUI app changes in `master`:

- Added a horizontal line marking the start of received [unread messages](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/137). Removed display of avatar and username if subsequent messages come from the same author.
- Added total DCR [sent and received](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/146) summaries to Payment Stats page.
- Added [QR codes](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/148) for deposit addresses.
- Hide [advanced fields](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/150) by default on screens prompting to open more inbound/outbound LN channels.
- Fixed loss of [active chat](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/145) selection when opening Chats section.

CLI app changes in `master`:

- Simplified code for opening channels and [requesting receive capacity](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/147).
- Allow to specify custom [addresses](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/149) that the embedded dcrlnd instance will listen to instead of the default `127.0.0.1`.
- Improved [text wrapping](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/132) and rendering of multiline elements.
- Added [key exchange mediation](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/134) and [author nickname](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/151) to automation API used by bots and other tools.

Other stuff:

- Oprah is out! It is a tipping bot following and rewarding authors of substantive posts or comments. Ask in the [#br](https://chat.decred.org/#/room/#br:decred.org) Matrix chat how to get tips from Oprah.

In February the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 7,620 DCR worth $183K at February's average rate of $24.03. 3,389 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $81K at February's rate, or $67K at December's billing rate of $19.79.

The [treasury spend tx](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/tx/e09505dbb877e5efdd184129858be5655a3de235cdac2cfa749442f0ccf7de81) had 27 outputs making payments to contractors, ranging from 3 DCR to 1,084 DCR. Most of this DCR was likely paid for December invoices, there is now a persistent lag between the end of the month and the creation of the TSpend for that month, so that by the time transactions are approved by stakeholders it is typically two months after the month when work was conducted.

There were no new proposals published in Feb, and the proposals which finished voting in the month were covered in the [January issue](202301.md#governance) of the Journal.


## Network

**Hashrate**: February's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) opened at ~73 Ph/s and closed ~71 Ph/s, bottoming at 60 Ph/s and peaking at 83 Ph/s throughout the month.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between 207-496.5 DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at 263.8 DCR (+51.3).

_Image: Ticket price made its biggest swing in history._

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) was 8.76-9.69 million DCR, meaning that 58.5-64.9% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) in Proof of Stake.

After a dramatic drop to 140 DCR in January ticket price skyrocketed to set a new all-time high of **496.5 DCR**. It returned to normal levels a week later and settled around 230 DCR.

**VSP**: The [16 listed VSPs](https://decred.org/vsp/) collectively managed ~7,410 (-980) live tickets, which was 18.4% of the ticket pool (-0.4%) as of Mar 1.

The only gainers in February were dcrhive.com (+383 tickets or +74%) and vsp.decredcommunity.org (+202 tickets or +38%). The other 14 VSPs lost ~25% tickets on average, but the loss should be considered in context of the ticket pool size correcting from abnormal ~44,880 down to its target of 40,960 ticket.

The share of [mixed coins](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&zoom=jz3q237o-la8vk000&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true-true-true) varied between 59.2-60.4%. Daily [mixed volume](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=privacy-participation&bin=day&axis=time) varied between 206-865K DCR.

Since a large portion of mixed coins comes from mixed staking, the drop of staked DCR has resulted in a drop of mixed volume. It went back to normal towards the end of February as stake participation recovered.

Localbitcoins, the longstanding facilitator of person to person Bitcoin exchanges, is [closing down](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/02/09/bitcoin-exchange-localbitcoins-to-close-citing-market-conditions/). After 10 years in action Localbitcoins could not withstand the "ongoing very cold crypto winter", and suspended trading on Feb 16, remaining online only for users to withdraw any balances.

Crypto exchange Kraken has [settled](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-25) with the SEC over "Unregistered Offer and Sale of Crypto Asset Staking-As-A-Service Program" and agreed to "Pay $30 Million to Settle SEC Charges". This has been presented as part of a larger [crackdown](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-is-cracking-down-on-crypto-staking-heres-what-to-know-f0922151) on exchange provided staking services, where exchanges generate revenue by staking users' tokens and pay some proportion of this to the token holders. The stated motivation for these actions is to provide investors with reliable information about what custodians of their tokens are using them for, but as Kraken CEO Jesse Powell has [tweeted](https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1624177588074848256), this is not as easy as filling in a form, and for companies that have tried to engage with the approval process it has [not gone well](https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1626609794260803584).

The Oasis DeFi protocol was used to "[counter-exploit](https://www.blockworksresearch.com/research/we-do-a-little-counter-exploit)" the hacker who stole 120,000 ETH from the Wormhole bridge in Feb 2022 and steal back funds they had deposited in the platform, after its developers were [ordered](https://blog.oasis.app/statement-regarding-the-transactions-from-the-oasis-multisig-on-21st-feb-2023/) to by a British High Court. After the Wormhole Bridge was exploited last year, Jump Crypto (its VC backer) stepped in to make users whole and has since been tracking the stolen funds with a view to retrieval. As [reported](https://blockworks.co/news/jump-crypto-wormhole-hack-recovery) by Blockworks, Jump Crypto likely played a key role in the retrieval, they provided funds to reclaim the collateral and close open positions and it is likely they are also the "Whitehat group" referenced in the Oasis blog post who provided a proof of concept on how the assets could be retrieved. The counter-exploit involved an upgradeable contract and adding a new signer to the 4-of-12 multisig that owns the Oasis contracts. It is not clear what the process was to generate the court order to perform the exploit.

Facebook parent Meta [reported](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/02/01/facebook-parent-metas-metaverse-division-lost-137b-in-2022/) losses of $13.7 billion in its Metaverse Division for 2022, and warned that the losses would accelerate further in 2023.

Optimism, a layer 2 Ethereum chain, [performed](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/lPZEkFF7LU2ZlrO-dsV3p_LtWQUaknFGfxFMgSz3vGA) its second airdrop, sending 11.7 million OP tokens to over 300,000 addresses. This airdrop rewarded users who delegated their OP for governance, and users who spent more than $6 on gas fees, along with multipliers for delegating more for longer or using more gas. Optimism is committed to distributing 19% of its supply in airdrops, and the first one in May 2022 distributed 5%. 
India is [aiming](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/08/unpacking-indias-cbdc-pilots-as-country-prepares-for-digital-rupee/) to launch its CBDC by the end of 2023 and has two ongoing trials for a wholesale and retail facing CBDC which have been expanding, but not without difficulty. India already has a ubiquitous Unified Payments Interface (UPI) operated by banks which is widely used and exposes user data to the bank operators - the retail CBDC is seen as a way to offer a more cash-like and privacy respecting means of making payments without bank intermediaries. 
Optimism, a layer 2 Etherem chain, [performed](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/lPZEkFF7LU2ZlrO-dsV3p_LtWQUaknFGfxFMgSz3vGA) its second airdrop, sending 11.7 million OP tokens to over 300,000 addresses.

In January National Australia Bank [became](https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/nab-creates-a-stablecoin-in-boost-for-digital-economy-20230117-p5cd8f) the second major Australian bank to create a stablecoin (AUDN) to allow business customers to settle transactions on blockchain technology in real-time using Australian dollars. They aim to launch mid-year and support transactions including overseas payments and carbon credit trading, and the stated purpose is to boost the digital economy. This comes 9 months after Melbourne based rival ANZ created a similar product (A$DC). The Reserve Bank of Australia is exploring use cases for CBDC and will choose some pilot projects in the first half of 2023.
