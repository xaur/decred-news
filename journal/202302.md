The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, meaning that {n.n}-{n.n}% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) in Proof of Stake.

Localbitcoins, the longstanding facilitator of person to person Bitcoin exchanges, is [closing down](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/02/09/bitcoin-exchange-localbitcoins-to-close-citing-market-conditions/). After 10 years in action Localbitcoins could not withstand the "ongoing very cold crypto winter", and suspended trading on Feb 16, remaining online only for users to withdraw any balances.

Crypto exchange Kraken has [settled](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-25) with the SEC over "Unregistered Offer and Sale of Crypto Asset Staking-As-A-Service Program" and agreed to "Pay $30 Million to Settle SEC Charges". This has been presented as part of a larger [crackdown](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-is-cracking-down-on-crypto-staking-heres-what-to-know-f0922151) on exchange provided staking services, where exchanges generate revenue by staking users' tokens and pay some proportion of this to the token holders. The stated motivation for these actions is to provide investors with reliable information about what custodians of their tokens are using them for, but as Kraken CEO Jesse Powell has [tweeted](https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1624177588074848256), this is not as easy as filling in a form, and for companies that have tried to engage with the approval process it has [not gone well](https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1626609794260803584).

The Oasis DeFi protocol was used to "[counter-exploit](https://www.blockworksresearch.com/research/we-do-a-little-counter-exploit)" the hacker who stole 120,000 ETH from the Wormhole bridge in Feb 2022 and steal back funds they had deposited in the platform, after its developers were [ordered](https://blog.oasis.app/statement-regarding-the-transactions-from-the-oasis-multisig-on-21st-feb-2023/) to by a British High Court. After the Wormhole Bridge was exploited last year, Jump Crypto (its VC backer) stepped in to make users whole and has since been tracking the stolen funds with a view to retrieval. As [reported](https://blockworks.co/news/jump-crypto-wormhole-hack-recovery) by Blockworks, Jump Crypto likely played a key role in the retrieval, they provided funds to reclaim the collatoral and close open positions and it is likely they are also the "Whitehat group" referenced in the Oasis blog post who provided a proof of concept on how the assets could be retrieved. The counter-exploit involved an upgradeable contract and adding a new signer to the 4-of-12 multisig that owns the Oasis contracts. It is not clear what the process was to generate the court order to perform the exploit.
