# Decred Journal — June 2018 DRAFT

![roadmap](../img/roadmap-300.jpg "Decred Roadmap")

## Development

The biggest announcement of the month was the new kind of decentralized exchange [proposed](https://blog.decred.org/2018/06/05/A-New-Kind-of-DEX/) by "jy-p of Company 0. The Community Discussions section considers the stakeholders' response.

dcrd: Peer management and connectivity improvements. Some work for [improved sighash algo](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/950). A new [optimization](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1273) that gives 3-4x faster serving of headers, which is great for SPV. This was another step towards multipeer parallel downloads — check [this issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1145) for a clear overview of progress and planned work for next months (and some engineering delight). As usual, codebase cleanup, improvements to error handling, test infrastructure and test coverage.

Decrediton: work towards watching only wallets, lots of bugfixes and visual design improvements. Preliminary work to integrate SPV has begun.

Politeia is live on testnet! Useful links: [announcement](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/1009552512968482818), [introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8sn1b8/test_the_politeia_proposal_system_on_testnet/), command line voting [example](https://gist.github.com/marcopeereboom/ee494a6864086e0b5a4ac8886a9c0397), [example proposal](https://test-proposals.decred.org/proposals/c5241806166d89286be56cd2605e7d76537eb32a40a8f8d8bde3bff4c2fc6585/) with some votes, [mini-guide](https://github.com/decred/politeia/blob/master/politeia.md) how to compose a proposal.

Trezor: Decred appeared in the [firmware update](https://blog.trezor.io/june-updates-trezor-one-firmware-wallet-zcash-cashaddr-doge-e21cbdf9807d) and on [Trezor website](https://trezor.io/coins/#DCR), currently for testnet only. Next steps are mainnet support and integration in wallets. For the progress of Decrediton support you can track [this meta issue](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1491).

dcrdata: Continued work on Insight API support, see this [meta issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/400) for progress overview. It is important for integrations due to its popularity. Ongoing work to add charts. A big database change to improve sorting on the Address page was [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/commit/006685be846ac9cfe7b9b76eebabdb7bffdaad18) and bumped version to 3.0. Work to visualize agenda voting [continues](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/523).

Ticket splitting: 11-way ticket split from last month [has voted](https://twitter.com/matheusd_tech/status/1007610236868399104) ([transaction](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/tx/957728a7b3b9ea02338552470535ca67a6bc4379b169959589b8a69060e764a8)).

Ethereum support in atomicswap is [progressing](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/issues/74) and welcomes more eyeballs.

decred.org: revamped [Press page](https://decred.org/press/) with dozens of added articles, and a shiny new [Roadmap page](https://decred.org/roadmap/).

[decredinfo.com](https://decredinfo.com/): a new Decred dashboard by lte13. Reddit announcement [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8tcs49/decredinfo_block_explorer_and_statistics_for/).

Dev activity stats for June: 245 active PRs, 184 master commits, 25,973 added and 13,575 deleted lines spread across 8 repositories. Contributions came from 2 to 10 developers per repository. ([chart](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1014267793041248257))

## Network

Hashrate: growth continues, the month started at 15 and ended at 44 PH/s with some wild 30% swings on the way. The peak was 53.9 PH/s.

F2Pool was the leader varying between 36% and 59% hashrate, followed by coinmine.pl holding between 18% and 29%.

F2Pool made a [statement](https://www.f2pool.com/help/profits/annoce) in response to concerns about its hashrate share:

> For the stable development of community, F2Pool has already ceased the promotion of DCR pool, and considers to take measure like raising up the mining fee to reduce the pool hashrate if it is necessary, to prevent the capability of 51% attack. Meanwhile, with responsibility and sense of justice, F2Pool reminds "NO evil" as the principle. Thus, we do not, and will never destroy the stability of community and seek improper profits through 51% attack.  
> Together with the community, we do sincerely hope to contribute to protect the healthy trend of Decred. ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3P6R055Z/p1529402169000047))

Staking: 30-day average ticket price is 94.7 DCR (+3.4). The price was steadily rising from 90.7 to 95.8 peaking at 98.1. Locked DCR grew from 3.68 to 3.81 million DCR, the highest value was 3.83 million corresponding to 47.87% of supply (+0.7% from previous peak).

Nodes: there are 240 public listening and 115 normal nodes per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats). Version distribution: 57% on v1.2.0 (+12%), 25% on v1.1.2 (-13%), 14% on v1.1.0 (-1%). Note: the reported count of non-listening nodes has dropped significantly due to data reset at decred.eu. It will take some time before the crawler collects more data. On top of that, there is no way to exactly count non-listening nodes. To illustrate, an alternative data source, charts.dcr.farm [showed](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000015/nodes-map) 690 reachable nodes on Jul 1.

Extraordinary event: [247361](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/247361) and [247362](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/247362) were two nearly full blocks. Normally blocks are 10-20 KiB, but these blocks were 374 KiB (max is 384 KiB).

## ASICs

[Update](https://medium.com/obelisk-blog/obelisk-update-may-june-2018-260fce12a825) from Obelisk: shipping is expected in first half of July and there is non-zero chance to meet hashrate target.

Another Chinese ASIC [spotted](https://www.dcrbi.com/) on the web: Flying Fish D18 with 340 GH/s at 180 W costing 2,200 CNY (~340 USD). ([asicok.com](https://asicok.com/d18.html) – [translated](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&hl=en&u=https://asicok.com/d18.html), also on [asicminervalue](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/ffminer/decred-d18))

dcrASIC team [posted](https://medium.com/@dcrasic/farewell-from-dcrasic-5327953088b0) a farewell letter. Despite having an awesome 16 nm chip design, they decided to stop the project citing the saturated mining ecosystem and low profitability for their potential customers.

## Integrations

[bepool.org](http://beepool.org/) is a new mining pool [spotted](https://dcred.eu/powStats) on dcred.eu.

Guarda Wallet integrated Decred. Currently only in their web wallet, but more may come in future. Notable feature is "DCR purchase with a bank card". See more details in their [post](https://medium.com/guarda/guarda-adds-decred-support-to-the-multi-currency-web-wallet-7ec9b88a7738) or ask their representative on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8pa74w/guarda_announces_decred_is_now_on_our/). Important: do your best to understand the security model before using any wallet software.

## Adoption

Merchants:

* [NeverFiat](https://www.neverfiat.com/) marketplace now [accepts](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8v0ii9/we_are_building_tomorrows_crypto_marketplace/) Decred. Notably it utilizes [GloBee](https://globee.com/) and recently announced [Lightning support](https://neverfiat.com/blogs/blog/neverfiat-accepts-lightning-network-payments) for Bitcoin.

We have tried to make it simple and user friendly. 10% of all purchases made in Decred will be donated to the Decred Development fund - and we will be releasing original Decred designs in the future".

BlueYard Capital [announced](https://twitter.com/blueyard/status/1007287271643598849) investment in Decred and the intent to be long term [supporters](https://twitter.com/ciaranoleary/status/1007288469952126977) and to actively participate in the network's governance. In an [overview post](https://medium.com/@BlueYard/decred-82b284b4a795) they stressed core values of the project:

> There are a few other remarkable characteristics that are a testament to the DNA of the team behind Decred: there was no sale of DCR to investors, no venture funding, and no payment to exchanges to be listed — underscoring that the Decred team and contributors are all about doing the right thing for long term (as manifested in their [constitution](https://docs.decred.org/getting-started/constitution/) for the project).

> The most encouraging thing we can see is both the quality and quantity of high calibre developers flocking to the project, in addition to a vibrant community attaching their identity to the project.

The company will be hosting an event in Berlin, see Events below.

Jake Yocom-Piatt did an [AMA on r/CryptoTechnology](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8nujuo/hello_this_is_jake_yocompiatt_ask_me_anything/), a forum for serious crypto tech discussion. Some topics covered were Decred attack cost and resistance, voting policies, smart contracts, SPV security, DAO and DPoS.

[A new kind of DEX](https://blog.decred.org/2018/06/05/A-New-Kind-of-DEX/) was the subject of an extensive discussion in [#general](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C0NRMDVMJ/p1528209752000802), [#random](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PAYQJTW/p1528210469000917), [#trading](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1528209357000114) channels as well as [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8orxdf/a_new_kind_of_decentralized_exchange_dex/). New channel [#thedex](https://decred.slack.com/messages/CB1BDE40Z/) was created and attracted more than 100 people.

A frequent and fair question is how the DEX would benefit Decred. @lukebp has put it well:

> Projects like these help Decred attract talent. Typically, the people that are the best at what they do aren’t driven solely by money.  They want to work on interesting projects that they believe in with other talented individuals.  
> Launching a DEX that has no trading fees, no requirement to buy a 3rd party token (including Decred), and that cuts out all middlemen is a clear demonstration of the ethos that Decred was founded on.  It helps us get our name out there and attract the type of people that believe in the same mission that we do. ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PAYQJTW/p1528212405000365))

Another concern that it will slow down other projects was addressed by @davecgh:

> The intent is for an external team to take up the mantle and build it, so it won't have any bearing on the current c0 roadmap.  The important thing to keep in mind is that the goal of Decred is to have a bunch of independent teams on working on different things. ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1528241447000199))

A [chat](https://twitter.com/AnselLindner/status/1003708357193150466) about Decred fork resistance started on Twitter and continued in [#trading](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1528138824000839). Community members continue to discuss the finer points of Decred's hybrid system, bringing new users up to speed and answering their questions. The key takeaway from this chat is that thee Decred chain is impossible to advance without votes, and to get around that the forker needs to change the protocol in a way that would make it clearly not Decred.

"Against community governance" [article](https://medium.com/@decanus/against-community-governance-326dc82b27d3) was discussed on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8qhc3v/against_community_governance_by_dean_eigenmann/) and [#governance](https://decred.slack.com/archives/CAAMEU56W/p1528466175000149).

"The Downside of Democracy (and What it Means for Blockchain Governance)" was another [article](https://www.coindesk.com/downside-democracy-means-blockchain-governance/) arguing against on-chain governance, discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8u4191/how_important_is_onchain_governance/).

## Markets

DCR opened the month at ~$93, reached monthly high of $110, gradually dropped to the low of $58 and closed at $67. In BTC terms it was 0.0125 -> 0.0150 -> 0.0098 -> 0.0105. The downturn coincided with a global decline across the whole crypto market.

In the middle of the month Decred was [noticed](https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/1007970492760969219) to be #1 in [onchainfx](https://onchainfx.com/) "% down from ATH" chart and on [this](https://twitter.com/coinztrader/status/1008379790250905601) chart by @CoinzTrader. Towards the end of the month it dropped to #3.

Microsoft acquired GitHub. There was some debate about whether it is a reason to look into alternative solutions like GitLab right now. It is always a good idea to have a local copy of Decred [source code](https://github.com/decred), just in case.

Status update from @sumiflow on correcting DCR supply on various sites:

> To begin with, none of the below sites were showing the correct supply or market cap for Decred but we've made some progress.  
> coingecko.com - corrected!, coinlib.io - corrected!, cryptocompare.com - corrected!, livecoinwatch.com - corrected!, worldcoinindex.com - corrected!  
> cryptoindex.co - awaiting fix, onchainfx.com - awaiting fix  
> coinmarketcap.com - refused to fix because devs have coins too? ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1528500418000009))

## About This Issue

This is the third issue of Decred Journal after [April](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/201804) and [May](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/201805).

The new public [Matrix logs](https://gist.github.com/jrick/458eab91a650f24be4237a7db7662dd3) look promising and we hope to transition to Matrix links instead of Slack links. In the meantime, the way to read Slack links is [explained](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/201805#about-this-issue) in the previous issue.

Most information from third parties is relayed directly from source after a minimal sanity check. The authors of Decred Journal have no ability to verify all claims. Please beware of scams and do your own research.

As usual, any feedback is appreciated: please comment on [Reddit](), [GitHub](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/issues) or [#writers_room](https://decred.slack.com/messages/C9HC2NVTM/). Contributions are welcome too, anything from initial collection to final review to translations.

Special thanks to @Haon for bringing May 2018 issue to [medium](https://medium.com/decred/decred-journal-may-2018-6ea021e4f26a).
