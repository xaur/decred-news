![Marco at Voice of Blockchain](../img/blockchainvoice-300.jpg "Marco at Voice of Blockchain")

# Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): Version 1.3.0 RC1 (Release Candidate 1) is out! The main features of this release are significant performance improvements, including some that benefit SPV clients. Full release notes and downloads are [on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.0-rc1).

The default minimum transaction fee rate was reduced from 0.001 to 0.0001 DCR/kB. Do not try to send such small fee transactions just yet, until the majority of the network upgrades.

Release process was [changed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1414) to use release branches and bump version on the master branch at the beginning of a release cycle. Discussed in [this chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$153487143956936pmKTp:decred.org).

The codebase is ready for the new Go 1.11 version. Migration to vgo module system is complete and the 1.4.0 release will be built using modules. The list of versioned modules and a hierarchy diagram are available [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/README.md#GoModules).

The testnet was reset and bumped to version 3.

Comments are welcome for the [proposal](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1412) to implement smart fee estimation, which is important for Lightning Network.

@matheusd recorded a code review [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eysGWVhDFWY) for new Decred developers that explains how tickets are selected for voting.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): Version [1.3.0 RC1](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.0-rc1) features new SPV sync mode, new ticket buyer, new APIs for Decrediton and a host of bug fixes. On the dev side, dcrwallet also [migrated](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1238) to the new module system.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): Version [1.3.0 RC1](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.0-rc1) adds the new SPV sync mode that syncs roughly 5x faster. The feature is off by default while it receives more testing from experienced users. Other notable changes are design polish and experimental Politeia integration.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): Proposal editing is [being developed](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/515) and has a [short demo](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/1032753235927425024). This will allow proposal owners to edit their proposal in response to community feedback before voting begins. The challenges associated with this feature relate to updating censorship tokens and maintaining a clear history of which version comments were made  on. @fernandoabolafio produced this [architecture diagram](https://twitter.com/oxfernando/status/1033390103534751746) which may be of interest to developers.

@degeri joined to perform security testing of Politeia and found [several issues](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Adegeri).

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): mainnet explorer upgraded to v2.1 with several new features. For users: credit/debit tx filter on address page, showing miner fees on coinbase transaction page, estimate yearly ticket rewards on [main page](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/), cool new hamburger menu and keyboard navigation. For developers: new [chain parameters](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/parameters) page, experimental Insight API support, endpoints for coin supply and block rewards, testnet3 support. Lots of minor API changes and frontend tweaks, many bug fixes and robustness improvements.

The upcoming v3.0 entered beta and is deployed on [beta.dcrdata.org](https://beta.dcrdata.org/). Check out the new [charts](https://beta.dcrdata.org/charts) page. Feedback and bug reports are appreciated. Finally, the development version v3.1.0-pre is on [alpha.dcrdata.org](https://alpha.dcrdata.org/).

[Android](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): updated to be compatible with the latest SPV code and is syncing, several performance issues are worked on. Details were posted [in chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$153332352649099xKBlX:decred.org). Alpha testing has started, to participate please join [#dev](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#dev:decred.org) and ask for the APK.

[iOS](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): backend is mostly complete, as well as the front end. Support for devices with smaller screens was improved. What works now: creating and recovering wallets, listing of transactions, receiving DCR, displaying and scanning QR codes, browsing account information, SPV connection to peers, downloading headers. Some bugs need fixing before making testable builds.

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): v0.6.0 beta [released](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/releases/tag/v0.6.0) with improved fee calculation and multiple bug fixes.

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): [introduced](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9807gs/new_governance_section_and_politeia_page_on/) new [Governance](https://docs.decred.org/governance/governance/) section that grouped some old articles as well as the new [Politeia](https://docs.decred.org/governance/politeia/) page.

@Richard-Red created a [concept repository](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/governance-docs) sandbox with policy documents, to illustrate the kind of policies that could be approved and amended by Politeia proposals.

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb): 8 [contributors](https://decred.org/contributors/) added and 4 removed, including 2 advisors (discussion [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/316)).

# Integrations

[www.d1pool.com](https://www.d1pool.com) joined the list of [stakepools](https://decred.org/stakepools/) for a total of 16.

Australian [CoinTree](https://www.cointree.com/) [added](https://twitter.com/CointreeAus/status/1032887014029316097) DCR trading. The platform supports fiat, there are some [limitations](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$15360557776482RfMJg:decred.org) during the upgrade to a new system but also [no fees](https://www.cointree.com/blog/new-coins-added-zcash-siacoin-steem-lisk-digibyte-and-more) in the "Early access mode". On a related note, CoinTree is [working](https://www.cointree.com/blog/bill-payments-feature-coming-soon) on a feature to pay household bills with cryptocurrencies it supports.

Three new OTC desks were added to [exchanges](https://decred.org/exchanges/) page at decred.org.

Comm systems news:

* Interruptions in the chat bridge led to some Slack messages not reaching other platforms, and consequently not being archived in Matrix.
* Several impersonators were detected and banned.
* After another debate about chat systems more people began testing and using Matrix, leading to some gardening on that platform:
  * Decred Matrix community was created: [+decred:decred.org](https://matrix.to/#/+decred:decred.org), it helps to see all Decred-related rooms and people.
  * [#privacy](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#privacy:decred.org) and [#design](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#design:decred.org) are now bridged.
  * One private work channel was successfully migrated to Matrix.
  * Stylish room avatars were set.
  * @Haon has prepared a short [guide](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DmXNuV7W4AsLEmH.jpg:large) to help new Matrix users get started and join the Decred rooms. 
* Inactive Slack channels were archived. If you miss them, let it be known.
* [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_%28software%29) was mentioned by several people as a possible alternative for Twitter.
* Two new Reddit [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/about/rules/) were added to prevent CAPS flood and duplicate submissions.

Highlights:

* A [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/95r578/proposed_changes_to_decred_jargon/) was started to discuss changes to Decred jargon with the intent to make it more consistent and accessible to newcomers. The question whether changing "official" terminology requires stakeholder approval was touched in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9807gs/new_governance_section_and_politeia_page_on/) and in [#documentation](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!tfqymymiNgzSUJTHqS:decred.org/$1535386492135ZGULG:decred.org).
* Project fund transparency and constitution were extensively discussed on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/96j9ai/transparency_in_payments_made_with_the_community/) and in [#general](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$153410896753432nExMw:decred.org).
* [Pre-proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/98lgwt/preproposal_the_first_politeia_proposalvote/) to use Politeia to approve Politeia as a legitimate decision-making tool for Decred.

# Markets

DCR started the month at USD 56 / BTC 0.0073 and had a two week decline. On Aug 14 the whole market took a [huge drop](https://archive.today/K5buy) and briefly went below USD 200B. Bitcoin went below USD 6,000 and top 100 cryptos lost 5-30%. The lowest point coincided with Bitcoin dominance peak at 54.5%. On that day Decred dived -17% and reached the bottom of USD 32 / BTC 0.00537. Since then it went sideways in the USD 35-45 / BTC 0.0054-0.0064 range. Around Aug 24, Huobi showed DCR trading volume above USD 5M and this coincided with a minor recovery.

StopAndDecrypt [published](https://hackernoon.com/asic-resistance-is-nothing-but-a-blockchain-buzzword-b91d3d770366) an extensive article "ASIC Resistance is Nothing but a Blockchain Buzzword" that is much in line with Decred's stance on ASICs.

The ongoing [debates](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/990ga9/siacoin_obelisk_fork_is_no_better_than_ethereum/) about the possible Sia [fork](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/94ji0q/a_community_proposal_to_resolve_the_obelisk/) yet again demonstrate the importance of a robust dispute resolution mechanism. Also, we are [lucky](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/956k6g/community_fork_proposal_detail_discussion_dev_fee/) to have the treasury.

Mark B Lundeberg, who [found](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/issues/58) a vulnerability in atomicswap earlier, [published](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8yp6gd/my_newest_a_way_to_perform_p2p_atomic_swaps/) a concept of more private peer-to-peer atomic swaps. (missed in July issue)

Medium took a [cautious stance](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000646167-Cryptocurrencies-on-Medium) on cryptocurrencies and triggered at least one project to [migrate](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-against-censorship-goodbye-medium-hello-ghost/) to Ghost (that same project previously [migrated](https://blog.aragon.org/announcing-our-migration-to-an-open-source-messaging-platform-420b25e74284/) away from Slack).

Regulation: Vietnam [bans](https://icobrothers.media/2018/08/14/vietnamese-authorities-have-officially-banned-mining-equipment-import/) mining equipment imports, China [halts](https://www.asiacryptotoday.com/china-halts-hosting-of-crypto-events-in-beijing-bans-crypto-news-accounts-on-wechat/) crypto events and tightens control of crypto chat groups.

Reddit [was hacked](https://www.wired.com/story/reddit-hacked-thanks-to-woefully-insecure-two-factor-setup/) by intercepting 2FA codes sent via SMS. The [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/93qnm5/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_you_need_to/) explains the impact. Yet another [data breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches) suggests to think twice before sharing any data with any company and shift to more secure authentication systems.

Intel and x86 dumpsterfire keeps [burning brighter](https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=153504937925732&w=2). Seek more secure hardware and operating systems for your coins.
