## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): merged bug fixes, improved test coverage and test infrastructure.

Work started to [port](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pulls?q=is%3Apr+updated%3A2019-05-01..2019-05-31+port) several rearrangements from upstream btcd in order to reduce coupling and split blockmanager and rpcserver into their own packages.

Another active area was [mining code](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pulls?q=is%3Apr+updated%3A2019-05-01..2019-05-31+mining) that is undergoing a series of code improvements and performance optimizations, e.g. to [remove getblocktemplate](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1736) and to [require](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1739) a valid template address. 

A major pending change to mining code that deserves a special mention is an [overhaul](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1748) of the background template generator (the function that miners call to receive templates to create blocks from). Currently, miners not familiar with the intricacies of Decred voting will occasionally produce valid blocks with the minimum 3 PoS votes, out of a possible 5. This is bad for PoW miners, who get a reduced subsidy for including fewer votes. This is also undesirable for PoS voters, who may not receive the PoS reward, despite having voted, simply due to propagation delay. To address this, the background template generator has been updated to add support for intelligent vote propagation, as well as a number of other features, such as better handling of chain reorganization to alternative blocks, a subscription that provides miners a stream of template updates, and consideration of the synchronization state as part of determining if the chain is current. It should be noted that this work only implements the infrastructure and does not yet expose this functionality in production.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

Merged:

* Added [cancellation support](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1457) for certain RPC operations {correct translation to English?}
* Improved [error handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1453).
* Simplified [concurrent code](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1451) and increased concurrent use of an unlocked wallet.
* [Bug fixes](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pulls?q=is%3Apr+updated%3A2019-05-01..2019-05-31+fix).

Work started on [CleanOutAccount](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1419) feature, which is similar to SweepAccount but allows multiple transactions.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton):

Merged:

* Implemented responsive design for [Transaction/History](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2124) view ([master issue](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1820)).
* Upgraded several [dependencies](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2108).

Work continues on initial [LN wallet](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2107) integration.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): Front end changes include an improved proposal list view, continuous loading of proposals while scrolling, and no more redirect when session expires - now a login modal window will pop up. The backend saw performance improvements and bug fixes, changes to the user database (user data at rest is now encrypted), and an updated API endpoint that allows non-admins to look up userID/username by public key. These lookups will allow for data about user comments and votes to be organized by user account rather than public key.

Contractor management system (CMS) continues to receive a [steady churn](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pulls?q=is%3Apr+updated%3A2019-05-01..2019-05-31+cms) of improvements and fixes.

[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd):

Work [continues](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pulls?q=is%3Apr+updated%3A2019-05-01..2019-05-31) to ready Decred's LN for mainnet, with bug fixes, improvements to integration tests, increased test coverage, and removal of unused code.

Work has begun to [reduce coupling](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/29) with dcrwallet and to [port](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/issues/12) Docker-related lnd files to dcrlnd to enable easier tinkering and development by the community. A [quickstart guide](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/8) has been started for knowledgeable individuals that want to get going faster. Work has also begun to port a lot of [upstream changes](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/36) made to [lnd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) since dcrlnd branched off to begin the initial port.

dcrlnd has been added to the [Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.decred.org/) on an experimental basis, with [caveats](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd#security).

[dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): dcrandroid saw minor bug fixes and UI optimizations, as well as a newly added send & estimation [function](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/pull/371). Code has been updated to be compatible with the current [dcrlibwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/pull/356) code.

[dcrios](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): development efforts ramped up in preparation for official launch. Bugs reported by users of the test app have been fixed, UI improvements have been made, and a large [refactoring](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/pull/391) was performed to remove bloat and improve test coverage. Apple Store release is imminent!

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): A markets [dashboard](https://alpha.dcrdata.org/market) has been added to the alpha site with most relevant market information, such as: USD and BTC price and volume from top Decred markets, indexes of BTC/USD price, charts of order book depth, volume and market history.

{is /markets powered by RG's dcrextdata or dcrdata's own implementation?}

{what is 'dcrrates' and how is it different from 'exchanges'?}

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs):

* Added new [Security](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/general-security/) page that captures a lot of wisdom about secure computing, including system setup and OPSEC.
* Updated [Transaction Details](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/transaction-details/) page adds more documentation for Decred-specific transaction types and a detailed [example transaction](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/937).
* [Updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/940/files) the [Consensus Vote Archive](https://docs.decred.org/governance/consensus-rule-voting/consensus-vote-archive/) page with better flow and more data.

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb): [Updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/662) the [Roadmap](https://decred.org/roadmap/) page, minor content and UI fixes.

Other:

* dcrstakepool (VSP software) received a [redesign](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/339).
* dcrd successfully [synced](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/1128763544118362112) on RISC-V QEMU. RISC-V is a hope for a less horrible CPU architecture.

## People

Welcome to new first time contributors with code merged to master branches: duyenemdo ([dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/commits?author=duyenemdo)), njirap ([dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/commits?author=njirap)), Nelson Dornelas Jr ([politeiagui](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/commits?author=dornelasN)) and Youssef Boukenken ([dcrtime](https://github.com/decred/dcrtime/commits?author=sefbkn)).

## Governance

In May the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 15,616 DCR and spent 8,456 DCR. Using May's daily average DCR/USD rate of $27.71, this is $433K received and $234K spent. As these payments were for work completed in April, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the April average daily rate of $24.22 - in which case the USD received/spent figures are $378K/$205K. As of Jun 1, Treasury balance is 613,840 DCR (17.3 million USD at $28.19).

Below is the proposal status as of Jun 1.

6 new proposals were submitted:

* [Block Header Commitments Consensus Change](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/0a1ff846ec271184ea4e3a921a3ccd8d478f69948b984445ee1852f272d54c58) by @davecgh, a proposal to move forward with a [DCP](https://github.com/decred/dcps) and on chain consensus rules change. This change would allow to bring the security of SPV clients almost to the level of fully validating nodes. The proposal projects a cost of $20,000 to prepare the software and the DCP, to be paid from the core development budget.

* [Ditto Communications Proposal for Decred: Phase 2](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/52ea110ea061c72d3b31ed2f5635720b212ce5e3eaddf868d60f53a3d18b8c04) by @lizbagot, a proposal to continue retaining the services of Ditto at $25K/month in DCR for a further 6 months. The proposal includes a recap of the last 6 months and details a 5 pronged approach for the next 6 months.

* [Decred Open Source Research proposal: Phase 2](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/67de0e901143400ae2f247391c4d5028719ffea8308fbc5854745ad859fb993f) by @richard-red, a proposal to continue funding the research program with $20,000, estimated to keep it going for 6 months. The proposal includes a report on the first 6 months activities, and a description of how the approach going forward will differ. The proposal also invites ideas about research projects in comments.

* [Decentralized Exchange Specification Document](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/a4f2a91c8589b2e5a955798d6c0f4f77f2eec13b62063c5f4102c21913dcaf32) by @jy-p, a proposal to move forward with the DEX by producing a "full RFC-style specification" of the processes involved. The specification would be completed by Company 0 working with @chappjc, @buck54321 and @jholdstock, at a cost of up to $20,000. 

* [Incentivizing BD Evangelists within the Decred Ecosystem](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/cb446a469987d6603d93f442ef0d4e45bacbea47a72b5ce89f9c3cac3868d627) by @betterfuture, a proposal to establish a "Decred Evangelists" business development team that would arrange co-development deals with partner organizations, and be rewarded with a percentage of any DCR contributed by those partners to the Treasury. The proposal was edited by @betterfuture on May 31 to say that it will be abandoned and re-submitted as two separate proposals, based on community feedback.

* [A Journey to the Future of Work- Telling the DCR story through Politeia](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/b9f342a0f917abb7a2ab25d5ed0aca63c06fe6dcc9d09565a9cde3b6fe7e6737) by @jer979, a proposal to  write an article about Politeia and the author's proposal submission journey. This proposal initially appeared to have good support, but after [comments](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/b9f342a0f917abb7a2ab25d5ed0aca63c06fe6dcc9d09565a9cde3b6fe7e6737/comments/29) about @jer979's past relationship with IOTA lost some of that support and was ultimately rejected with 48.6% approval (and voter participation of 44%, the second highest participation rate in Politeia's history).

1 additional proposal finished voting and was approved:

* [Decentralize Treasury Spending](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f) by @moo31337, proposed a method of decentralizing Treasury spending with a monthly on chain vote to approve payments to contractors. It was approved with 97.5% Yes votes.

The first constitution amendment has been [applied](https://docs.decred.org/governance/decred-constitution/) on docs.decred.org. 

@degeri published a Bounty program [status update](https://bounty.decred.org/) on May 15, reporting that 49 submissions had been processed so far with 7 eligible for a payout. 

Politeia Digest has more in depth coverage of these proposals and associated developments, see [issue 15](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/politeia-digest/blob/master/issue-015.md) and [issue 16](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/politeia-digest/blob/master/issue-016.md) that were released in May.

## Network

Hashrate: May's hashrate opened at ~524 Ph/s and closed ~574 Ph/s, bottoming at 364 Ph/s and peaking at 626 Ph/s throughout the month. Pool hashrate distribution as of Jun 1: Poolin 20%, lab.antpool.com 18%, BTC.com 8.7%, F2Pool 7.7%, UUPool 7.7%, Luxor 2%, BeePool 0.86%, CoinMine 0.28%, suprnova 0.02% and others 35.4% per [dcrstats.com](https://dcrstats.com/pow). Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was 116 DCR (-1.2) per dcrstats.com. The price varied between 109.7-124.7 DCR. Locked amount was 4.68-4.83 million DCR, which corresponded to 47.60-49.17% of the available supply per [dcr.farm](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000003/proof-of-stake).

Nodes: as of Jun 2 there were 270 public nodes. In that snapshot, 168 nodes were IPv4 with the following continent distribution: Europe 53%, North America 39%, Asia 7%. Top countries: USA 31.6%, Germany 14%, France 10%, Canada 7.8%, UK 5.4%, Netherlands 5.4%. Thanks to @chappjc for the snapshot.

Another useful source of node stats is dcr.farm. Throughout May it shows a large variation in the count of v1.4.0 nodes (103-237), but it has a nice [chart](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=1556582400000&to=1559390400000) of node version history that gives a general idea that the network is mostly on v1.4.0+ now.

The source of our previous node stats (dcred.eu) was shut down and we are thankful for all the info it served. A feature request to add similar stats to dcrdata is discussed [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/1214).

Soon after the activation of the new consensus rules, there was a [transaction](https://twitter.com/RichardRed0x/status/1127280791002787843) that made use of the new rules, the nodes that did not recognize this got forked off. We had a steady stream of people dropping by on the support channels throughout the month as many of their wallets stopped syncing. There was no major network level outage observed.

## Mining

Mining pool ViaBTC [announced](https://pool.viabtc.com/announcements/85) that they now support Decred mining.

## Integrations

HitBTC exchange [added](https://twitter.com/hitbtc/status/1128226645280788480) DCR/BTC, DCR/ETH and DCR/USDT pairs.

[Nomiddleman Crypto](https://nomiddlemancrypto.io/) [added](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/buhl35/decred_woocommerce_payment_gateway_open) Decred support to their WooCommerce plugin that allows to accept crypto payments to merchant's own wallet addresses without involving third parties. Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nomiddleman/nomiddleman-woocommerce).

[Ownbit](https://twitter.com/bitbillwallet/status/1126659323893968896) (formerly BitBill) added DCR support in their cold wallet.

## Adoption

[Trippki.com](https://trippki.com/) [announced](https://twitter.com/Trippki_/status/1125131845673410561) DCR support in their hotel booking service.

[ADHOC](https://adhoc.zone/), a company that focuses on ethical and privacy-respecting hardware and software [announced](https://twitter.com/adhoc_zone/status/1126653081259839488) that they accept DCR as a payment method. As of writing, ADHOC sells refubrished Samsung Galaxy S2 and S3 with software for private communications and Replicant OS (fully free Android distribution that once [featured](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/replicant-developers-find-and-close-samsung-galaxy-backdoor) on fsf.org for finding a backdoor in a Samsung phone), Librebooted ThinkPad X220 with Tails, and a ebook reader. The products are mirrored on OpenBazaar [store](https://openbazaar.com/store/QmTQNzpvq1Lgx6NvXhnoiWirLV1oQbF9LJZwMENKoPYVon).

[Cryptwerk.com](https://cryptwerk.com/) directory collected a [list of businesses](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/bp035s/decred_accepted_here_the_list_of_businesses_where/) accepting DCR.

## Outreach

Decred was busy in May laying the groundwork for a more decentralized operational rollout. Much of the work in May was focused in and around NYC Blockchain Week, where approximately fifteen community members got together with an extended group of exchanges, miners, institutional partners, and more. [Decred Africa](https://t.me/DecredAfrica) Telegram group was launched and coordinated a presentation at Blockchain Nigeria is Lagos on May 24. In NYC, various community members attended the Magical Crypto Conference on May 10-11, then Consensus the following three days. At Consensus, @jy-p presented a 30 minute update on Decred's funding and roadmap at their Changelogs track. Additionally, @jy-p spoke later that day at Ditto PR & The Block's first ever conference, Atomic Swap. @jy-p was on a panel with Beam, Dash and Orbs, and debated decentralization and governance with the other representatives. Decred coordinated a dinner with members of its Asian community and determined a strategy to penetrate the Asian market, prioritizing China in the immediate term. @Dominic and @changhugo are planning an event to promote and host a meetup in Beijing in the near future.

@anshawblack traveled to New York for NYC Blockchain week and recorded podcasts with @jz, @MustStopMurad, Joel Monegro, @lukebp, @jholdstock, and Permabull Nino. The first podcast with @jz was [released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcEJuN7zh2M), with others to follow.

@Dustorf released the first part of the Decred Assembly, a segment titled Decred Distributed that looks at markets across the world and talks with local community organizers to understand what Decred is doing in those areas. The first [edition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7GYD8zwOe8) featured @elian, who is leading efforts in Mexico and doing a lot of great work in Latin America. In early June, multiple additional segments will be released, including an in-depth discussion with @jy-p about the DEX proposal.

Ditto's May achievements:

* Ditto and The Block hosted Atomic Swap, an invite-only event during Blockchain Week NYC attended by 150 crypto influencers, media, investors, and enthusiasts, and sponsored by Decred. The Block published a [story](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/sponsored/atomic-swap-presented-by-decred-and-zebpay/) prior to the event.
* @jy-p spoke on "The Idealist's Dilemma" panel at Atomic Swap, where he debated what it means to be a decentralized protocol alongside Beam, Dash, and Orbs.
* Reporters from top-tier media such as Bloomberg, The Block, Bitcoin Magazine, Fortune and other outlets attended Atomic Swap. Team Ditto was also able to meet several Decred community members in person there, including @akinsawyerr, @anshawblack, @jholdstock, @lukebp, @jy-p, @jz, @Dustorf.
* @liz\_bagot and @treydpr from Ditto answered the community's questions on a Reddit [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/bm9as0/ama_livestream_with_liz_and_trey_from_ditto_pr/) and livestreamed video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8XjAOMX-VM) 
* @jy-p and @MustStopMurad met with reporters from BTC Manager, The Information, and Bitcoin Magazine during Blockchain Week NYC.
* @jy-p quoted about Facebook getting into crypto in: [Crowdfund Insider](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2019/05/147078-blockchain-industry-comments-on-expected-facebook-cryptocurrency-facebook-is-the-antithesis-of-what-cryptocurrency-stands-for/), [Live Bitcoin News](https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/facebook-coin-is-garnering-mixed-reactions/), and [The Daily Hodl](https://dailyhodl.com/2019/05/07/crypto-economist-behind-the-mit-bitcoin-experiment-is-reportedly-working-on-facebooks-new-coin/).
* @moo31337 [spoke](https://soundcloud.com/matthew-aaron-690749808/horizen-decred-casino-coin-101) with host Matthew Aaron on the Crypto 101 podcast. Starts at 17:32.
* @MustStopMurad [appeared](https://cheddar.com/media/after-40-million-hack-bitcoin-climbs-to-6-000-for-the-first-time-this-year) on Cheddar TV, where he mentions Decred at 2:07.
* [Mention](https://btcmanager.com/blockchains-neglect-social-contracts-will-likely-fail/) of Decred in BTCManager from after Blockchain week meeting.
* The Information quoted @jy-p in a [story](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/can-crypto-crack-the-retail-market) about the launch of Spedn.
* @MustStopMurad was [quoted](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2019/05/10/why-is-bitcoin-leaving-top-cryptos-in-the-dust/) in Forbes and mentions Decred: "While Bitcoin has been outperforming altcoins since April, I think altcoins which have tracked BTC movements most closely are the ones being accumulated by 'Smart money' investors and VCs: coins like Decred, Tezos, and Monero." 
* Secured a speaking slot for @jy-p about decentralization and Decred's funding mechanism at the Voice of Blockchain, an event that will take place in Chicago this fall.
* Worked with the community to finalize a byline on Decred's approach to staking.

Reddit: 

A [resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/bp035s/decred_accepted_here_the_list_of_businesses_where/) tracking businesses that accept DCR in exchange for products or services.

A post complaining that the Treasury is being [milked](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/bsk1l4/the_treasury_is_getting_milked_by_those_useless/) by useless marketing projects, written on the assumption that the "journey to the future of work" proposal would be approved, inspired spirited discussion about the merits of that particular proposal and marketing efforts generally.

A [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/bnep6p/if_you_were_running_decrediton_at_13_or_earlier/) observing that people who did not update in time had now been forked off the network following a transaction which utilized the new rules. The post explained how to recover from this scenario.

Some [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/bpgv33/why_is_poloniex_delisting_decred/) about the geofencing of DCR on Poloniex

A [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/bth5od/microsoft_building_on_bitcoin_is_actually_amazing/) about why Microsoft building on Bitcoin is good news for Decred too inspired in depth discussion of the merits of blockchain-based identity systems.

## Markets

In May DCR was trading between USD 23.6-35 / BTC 0.0032-0.0045. The average daily rate was $27.71.

Bitcoin rose steadily from ~5500 and even crossed 9000 USD for a brief amount of time. Right now it seems to be consolidating to break the 9000 USD barrier. It is very interesting to note that “9000” has a very significant “meme” value due to the [“Its over 9000”](https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-9000-vegeta-memes-coming/) meme.

EOS Block Producers [burned](https://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/bm75ih/the_mainnet_34m_eos_accumulated_4_inflation_is/) 34 million EOS (~$272 million) from the eosio.saving account. These funds had accumulated from the 4% inflation which was to be used to fund project development through a [Worker Proposal System](https://medium.com/eosys/eos-worker-proposal-system-announcement-6addcfb0134c). This idea fell out of favor with the EOS BPs and community, and 15 BPs supported the proposal to burn accumulated savings [on](https://www.eosx.io/tx/26ca16319febafc0942a8c6e3be26c16b84846b7cfe5f6ade906a0b86a6c2bb7?listView=actions) May 8. New tokens are still accumulating in the savings account, but this seems likely to be removed as there is an open [referendum](https://eosauthority.com/polls_details?proposal=inflation_20190307&prev=search) to remove the 4% inflation for development entirely, which has almost unanimous support from around 2.7% of EOS tokens that have voted.

Zooko [commented](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/the-future-of-zcash-in-the-year-2020/32372/173) on a long-running discussion about the future of Zcash development to express support for a new dev fund. Zcash currently allocates 20% of the block rewards to a founders reward but this is due to end sometime in 2020. Zooko and many other advocates think the new dev fund needs to be more decentralized than the current setup of relying on the Electronic Coin Company.

Tezos Athens upgrade [activated](https://www.coindesk.com/in-first-tezos-blockchain-activates-upgrade-by-token-holder-voting) on May 30, marking the end of a process that began in February to select a proposal, endorse it, test it and activate it. One of the lesser discussed aspects of the protocol upgrade was the [generation](https://twitter.com/wisercharlie/status/1134240285238501376) of 100 new XTZ to be claimed by the upgrade's developers for a round of drinks. This has been described as a method of [funding development](https://medium.com/tocqueville-group/why-tezos-is-the-best-platform-for-tokenized-assets-89a960cfa828) in future, with the developers who make a protocol change proposal incorporating the generation of new XTZ which they can claim as a reward for their work.

Dash [Ventures](https://blog.dash.org/introducing-the-dash-investment-foundation-370cafcc48ee) investment foundation is nearing completion, and Dash will be holding an election to select a set of supervisors to oversee its operation. The Dash Investment Foundation will be able to take ownership of equity or other assets in consideration for network funding. The election to fill the remaining 4 of 6 supervisor seats [started](https://blog.dash.org/details-on-the-election-for-dash-investment-foundation-supervisors-25766c55a1f) on May 30, and will be followed by budgetary proposals to fund the foundation's administrative costs and allocate some capital for it to invest,

The [Open Money Initiative](https://medium.com/@openmoneyinitiative/announcing-the-open-money-initiative-61422b58ad06) was announced, a research nonprofit which will study how money is used in closed economies with collapsing monetary systems. The initiative's first project is an ethnographic study in Venezuela. The initiative is supported by funding from Zcash, Stellar, Tezos and the Cosmos supported Interchain Foundation - among others.

A Bitcoin Cash hard fork on May 15 was beset by [several](https://blog.bitmex.com/the-bitcoin-cash-hardfork-three-interrelated-incidents/) issues and in the ensuing chaos, 3,391 BCH (~$1.35 million) were double spent. A bug with Bitcoin ABC led to invalid transactions filling up the mempool and a series of empty blocks being mined. Some miners began mining blocks on the pre-hardfork chain, causing a chain split. Immediately after the bug was resolved, a 2 block reorg occurred in which funds that the hardfork made spendable by any miners were double spent. It seems likely the dominant BCH miners reorged the chain to remove transactions in which these coins were claimed by another miner.

Poloniex has been busy in May, delisting [Peercoin](https://talk.peercoin.net/t/team-update-28-poloniex-delisting-legal-risks-memo-exchange-expansion-plans/9278) and a number of other cryptocurrencies, "[geofencing](https://medium.com/circle-trader/poloniex-to-stop-offering-trading-of-9-assets-to-us-customers-all-assets-remain-available-to-b4c5703c0e9)" DCR and 8 other cryptocurrencies so that US-based customers cannot trade it, and   [announcing](https://medium.com/circle-trader/cosmos-atom-staking-is-coming-to-poloniex-d587d6c6615d) support for Cosmos staking. The decision to geofence DCR on the basis of regulatory uncertainty is perplexing, given the many [reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/ahuawl/decred_launch_security_laws/eeiaa0n/) why DCR should not be considered a security and concurrent support for ICO projects that seem more likely to be deemed securities. In a follow up [post](https://blog.circle.com/2019/05/20/us-crypto-policy-needs-to-change/), Circle CEO explained that the move is triggered by the [recent guidance](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets) from the SEC. Notably, the linked page says "This framework represents Staff views and is not a rule, regulation, or statement of the Commission.  The Commission has neither approved nor disapproved its content. This framework, like other Staff guidance, is not binding on the Divisions or the Commission.". Another [post](https://blog.circle.com/2019/05/23/our-take-interpreting-recent-signals-from-us-regulatory-agencies/) from Circle further elaborated on their position and complained about the difficulties caused by uncertainty from US regulators.

In response to the confusing digital assets framework, Kin Foundation [started](https://twitter.com/ResearchCircle/status/1134541879675166722) a Defend Crypto [initiative](https://www.defendcrypto.org/) by which they collect donations to take SEC to court.

As of Apr 30, Tether was only backed by 74% as told by their lawyer https://www.coindesk.com/tether-lawyer-confirms-stablecoin-74-percent-backed-by-cash-and-equivalents

Binance suffered a security [breach](https://binance.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028031711) which resulted in the loss of 7,000 BTC. The breach was a result of hackers obtaining a large number of user API keys and 2FA codes. On twitter, @JeremyRubin [suggested](https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin/status/1125919526485254144) that if Binance released their private keys for the hacked coins (or a subset) they could coordinate a reorg to undo the theft. CZ was participating in an AMA soon after the breach was announced and mentioned that he was considering this proposition. This sparked uproar on crypto twitter, with much discussion of whether this was a viable or advisable approach. The subject also received some in depth [treatment](https://research.circle.com/weekly-recaps/weekly-crypto-recap-to-reorg-or-not-to-reorg). Ultimately CZ decided [not](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1125996194734399488) to pursue an attempted reorg because it would damage BTC's credibility and potentially split the chain/community. The losses would instead be covered by the Binance safu fund.

Another [sad story](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-most-expensive-lesson-of-my-life-details-of-sim-port-hack-35de11517124) surfaced of a person's poor security practices leading to a loss of >$100K in crypto. Hint: SMS 2FA is insecure and of course, don't keep that much on an exchange.

Intel [disclosed](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/291474-intel-discloses-new-speculative-execution-security-vulnerabilities) a new set of Speculative execution vulnerabilities.

Firefox users went through a frustrating experience of software that worked yesterday suddenly stopped working. Most Firefox addons were disabled around May 3 due to an (unexpected?) expiration of code signing certificate, a bug dubbed ['armagadd-on-2.0'](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1548973). This included addons that protect user privacy and security by blocking tons of unwanted ad and spyware content on the web. Mozilla published a [notice](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/05/04/update-regarding-add-ons-in-firefox/) that as a part of the solution, a "fix will be automatically applied in the background" delivered via the Studies system while a more general fix is in the works.
