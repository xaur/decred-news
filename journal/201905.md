## Development

{add below overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warranets a paragraph, drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans}

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): {}

Merged:
* wire: Add tests for MsgCFHeaders.https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1732 (simple test added..?)
* rpctest: Allow custom miner on voting wallet: https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1751 (significant to end user or just speeding up simnet for devs?)
* TravisCI: Disable race detector.: https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1749 (optional feature to speed up testing)
* peer: Prevent last block height going backwards.https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1747 (can't parse. bug fix?)
* wire: Add tests for MsgCFHeaders.: https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1732

Open:
* blockchain: update CalcBlockSubsidy.: https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1750 (performance optimization?)
* May saw a major optimization for PoW miners, with an [overhaul](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1748) of the background template generator (the function that miners call to receive templates to create blocks from). Currently, new miners not familiar with the intricacies of Decred voting will occasionally produce valid blocks with the minimum 3 votes from PoS voters (out of a possible 5). This is bad for PoW miners, who get a reduced subsidy for including fewer votes. This is also undesirable for PoS stakers, who may not receive the PoS reward, despite having voted, simply due to propagation delay. To address this, the background template generator has been updated to add support for intelligent vote propagation, as well as a number of other features, such as better handling of chain reorganization to alternative blocks, a subscription that provides miners a stream of template updates, and consideration of the synchronization state as part of determining if the chain is current. It should be noted that this work only implements the infrastructure and does not yet expose this functionality in production.  (this is potentially the biggest update, so have taken a stab at rewording davecgh's long commit message)
* mining: require a valid template address: https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1739 (minor update, not sure if relevant)
* mining: require a valid template address: https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1736 (looks related to larger change above)
* rpcserver: refactor listener logic to server. https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1734 (port from btcd, might be notable)
* blockmanager: remove serverPeer from blockmanager completely.https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1735 (port from btcd, might be notable)
* rpcserver: don't use activeNetParams. https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1733 (port from btcd, might be notable)
* connmgr: Add DialContext API https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1729 (not sure if important)


[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): {}

Merged:
* Add context to RPC method handlers: https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1457 (important?)
* Return early with context error from spv rescan. https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1456 (bug fix) 
* Require ticket price limit configs to be non-zero to apply: https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1454 (bug fix)
* Add errors.Cause to find inital cause of error: https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1453 (meta bug fixing? i.e. bug feature?)
* Lock selected previous outputs for concurrent UTXO selection: https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1452 (possibly important??)
* Replace wallet locking management goroutine with mutexes: https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1451 (possibly a relevant feature we should describe in high-level terms that make sense to user)
* Bump to wallet/v1.2.3: https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1449 (just looks like changing the version numbers, but do we have an actual minor version bump to announce?)
* Fix cursor indexes to derive next address: https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1447 (bug fix)

Open:
* multi: allow wallet unlocks via a passphrase token: https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1437 (opened Apr 24th, not sure if we covered already? remember similar feature added last mo)
* wip: add CleanOutAccount: https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1419 (seems like interesting new feature, WIP tho, not sure exactly the significance to the user)

LND: {}

Work continues to ready LND for mainnet, with bug fixes, improvements to integration tests to make them more stable and [run faster](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/32) on simnet, increased test coverage, and removal of unused code and references to BTC/LTC. Work has begun to [port](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/issues/12) Docker-related dcrlnd files to dcrlnd to enable easier tinkering and development by the community, and a [quickstart guide](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/8) has been started for knowledgeable individuals that want to
get going faster. Work has also begun to start porting [upstream changes](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/36) made to [lnd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) since dcrlnd branched off to begin the initial port. 

dcrlnd has been added to the [Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.decred.org/) on an experimental basis, with [caveats](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd#security).

## Governance

In May the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received {n} DCR and spent {n} DCR. Using May's daily average DCR/USD rate of ${n.nn}, this is ${n}K received and ${n}K spent. As these payments were for work completed in April, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the April average daily rate of ${n.nn} - in which case the USD received/spent figures are ${n}K/${n}K. As of {date}, Treasury balance is {n} DCR ({n.nn} million USD at ${n.nn}).

## Outreach
Decred was intensely busy in May laying the groundwork for a more decentralized operational rollout. Much of the work in May was focused in and around NYC Blockchain Week, where approximately fifteen community members got together with an extended group of exchanges, miners, institutional partners, and more. An Africa Telegram group (Decred Africa) was launched and coordinated a presentation at Blockchain Nigeria is Lagos on May 24th. In NYC, various community members attended the Magical Crypto Conference May 10-11, then Consensus the following three days. At Consensus, Jake presented a 30 minute update on Decred's funding and roadmap at their Changelogs track. Additionally, Jake spoke later that day at Ditto PR & The Block's first ever conference, AtomicSwap. Jake was on a panel with Beam, DASH and Orbs, and debated decentralization and governance with the other representatives. Decred coordinated a dinner with members of its Asian community and determined a strategy to penetrate the Asian market, prioritizing China in the immediate term. Dominic and Hugo are planning an event in partnership with Blockbeats, a major crypto media player, to promote and host a meetup in Beijing in the near future.

Anshawblack traveled to New York for NYC Blockchain week and recorded podcasts with JZ, Murad Madhudov, Joel Monegro, Luke Powell, Jamie Holdstock, and Permabull Nino. The first podcast with JZ will release June 1st, with others to follow.

Dustin released the first part of the Decred Assembly, a segment titled 'Decred Distributed' that looks at markets across the world and talks with local community organizers to understand what Decred is doing in those areas. The first edition featured Elian Huesca, who is leading efforts in Mexico and doing a lot of great work in Latin America. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7GYD8zwOe8 In early June, multiple additional segments will be released, including an in-depth discussion with jy-p about the DEX proposal.

Another [delisting](https://archive.today/sZBC7) spree by Poloniex yet again slashed the prices of several assets. Among them was Peercoin, the pioneer of Proof of Stake. The logic of Poloniex is a bit unclear because Peercoin [doesn't look like](https://twitter.com/peercoinppc) dead while CLAM's [master](https://github.com/nochowderforyou/clams/commits/master) was last updated in Jan 2017 but it keeps surviving the delisting runs and is even available [on margin trading](https://poloniex.com/marginTrading).

Poloniex [announced](https://medium.com/circle-trader/cosmos-atom-staking-is-coming-to-poloniex-d587d6c6615d) staking for Cosmos's ATOMs while maintaining the ability to trade.

Poloniex [announced](https://twitter.com/Poloniex/status/1129100271353827328) that DCR will no longer be available to US-based customers.

* While DCR has many [arguments](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/ahuawl/decred_launch_security_laws/eeiaa0n/) against being a security, "regulatory concerns" do not prevent Poloniex from trading assets that are significantly centralized or did huge ICOs. In fact, they have [assisted](https://blog.circle.com/2019/03/14/poloniex-welcomes-cosmos-enables-preview-and-redemption-of-ico-atoms/) one ICO in March.
* In a follow up [post](https://blog.circle.com/2019/05/20/us-crypto-policy-needs-to-change/), Circle CEO explained that the move is triggered by the [recent guidance](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets) from the SEC. Notably, the linked page says "This framework represents Staff views and is not a rule, regulation, or statement of the Commission.  The Commission has neither approved nor disapproved its content. This framework, like other Staff guidance, is not binding on the Divisions or the Commission.".

Another [sad story](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-most-expensive-lesson-of-my-life-details-of-sim-port-hack-35de11517124) surfaced of a person's poor security practices leading to a loss of >$100K in crypto. Hint: SMS 2FA is insecure and of course, don't keep that much on an exchange.



{other: regulations, security, fun}

Firefox users went through a frustrating experience of software that worked yesterday suddenly stopped working. Most Firefox addons were disabled around May 3 due to an (unexpected?) expiration of code signing certificate, a bug dubbed ['armagadd-on-2.0'](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1548973). This included addons that protect user privacy and security by blocking tons of unwanted ad and spyware content on the web. Mozilla published a [notice](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/05/04/update-regarding-add-ons-in-firefox/) that as a part of the solution, a "fix will be automatically applied in the background" delivered via the Studies system while a more general fix is in the works.
