## Upgrade for the Coming Fork!

Voting has concluded for two consensus changes [Change PoW to BLAKE3 and ASERT](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0011/dcp-0011.mediawiki) and [Change PoW/PoS Subsidy Split To 1/89](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0012/dcp-0012.mediawiki) which were originally [proposed on Politeia](https://proposals.decred.org/record/a8501bc) in March 2023.

Both changes have been **approved** with 99%+ Yes votes and 60%+ voter turnout. Changes are now [locked in](https://docs.decred.org/governance/consensus-rule-voting/overview/) and will activate in block 794,368 around August 29. Remaining time can be tracked at the [Voting Dashboard](https://voting.decred.org/) or at [dcrdata Agendas](https://dcrdata.decred.org/agendas).

All users are recommended to upgrade to latest [core software](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries), [standalone DEX app](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases), or any [other wallets](https://decred.org/wallets/) being used. As always, we recommend to [verify the files](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/verifying-binaries) before running.

## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

The following work has been merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Updated `GetBlock` and `GetBlockHeader` commands to show [the new proof of work hash](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3154). For blocks after [DCP-11: Change PoW to BLAKE3 and ASERT](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0011/dcp-0011.mediawiki) activates, the *proof of work hash* will be the new BLAKE3 hash. For blocks prior to DCP-11, the *block hash* and the *proof of work hash* will be identical. This update enables consumers like [dcrdata](#dcrdata) to easily access the new hashes.
- Updated the [Docker image](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3158) to build the dcrd binary with newer Go and Alpine Linux. Node admins can consider Docker a good security option as opposed to using a virtual machine which has a much bigger attack surface.
- Updated the RPC server to [dynamically reload new RPC certificates](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3153) without shutting down and restarting. This is a quality-of-life improvement for node admins, since it enables them to hot-swap the server certificate/key pair, as well as any potential client certificates. For example, a certificate update is required when the RPC server is exposed publicly and its IP address or domain name changes. Another example is when client certificates need to be modified to revoke clients, add new ones, or allow existing clients to change their private keys. This update is robust, minimizes disk access, does not require platform-specific dependencies, and is resilient against user-errors to avoid breaking a working config.
- Explicitly configured RPC clients connecting to dcrd via HTTP to [use TLS v1.2 or higher](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3169). This was already the implicit minimum, but now it is more clear.

Developer and internal changes merged in `master`:

- Updated the comments detailing the [ASERT calculation coefficients](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3156) in the mining code so that they match the consensus code comments.
- Added a [new linter](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3157), addressed some [linter complaints](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3155), and moved [linting logic](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3161) to its own script outside of the testing script.
- Updated [Github Actions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3159), and ensured that the continuous integration actions happen in the [correct order](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3166).
- Updated [golangci linter](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3163), and changed its [method of installing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3162) from `curl` to `go install`, which has the benefit of reducing potential security risks from supply-chain attacks. Also, cached the binary for faster future runs.
- Current versions of Go have a confusing way of handling loops. Both "for loops" and "range loops" treat internal loop variables ambiguously, which has led to code which is difficult to read and tricky to debug. Devs have had to treat loops with an abundance of caution, yet still potentially deal with annoying errors. A full explanation of the problem can be [read here](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/60078-loopvar.md), especially the section which talks about [the rationale](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/60078-loopvar.md#rationale-and-compatibility). Future versions of Go (likely 1.22) will introduce a breaking change to how loops are handled. While the new loop semantics will be less confusing and error-prone, projects will have to set a very high minimum supported Go version to avoid bugs when compiled with older Go. To ensure the dcrd code will work correctly with Go 1.22, as well as remain backwards-compatible and compile correctly with older versions of Go, [all necessary loops were updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3165). This will avoid any potential issues before they even have a chance to arise.


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

The following work has been merged in `master` towards future releases.

The primary improvements users may notice are related to purchasing tickets through a VSP:

- Fixed broken [retrying logic](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2252) for errored VSP ticket purchases. This issue affected many users. Any ticket purchases which worked first time were unaffected, but any purchases which ran into an error were not being retried, which would lead to tickets not being added to the VSP and votes being missed. Thankfully, re-registering the ticket with a different VSP was a workaround, but obviously it was poor UX.
- Fixed a bug where the [fee payment status check](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2269) could be unreasonably delayed. The VSP client delays actions by some random duration in order to help protect privacy. With this incorrect delay calculation the wallet would report fee payments as being unconfirmed for up to 2 hours until the next check happens, when actually the fee has been sent and confirmed. Now the user wallet will update sooner.
- Require VSP clients to [wait for the VSP to confirm fee payments](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2271) before considering a VSP ticket fully purchased. This eliminates multiple problematic edge cases caused by users broadcasting their own fee transactions, such as paying too low of a fee or sending payment to the wrong address. It is a preventative fix for extremely unlikely cases which have not been seen in the wild.
- Fixed a bug where some VSP tickets could be [skipped and not updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2266) during various stages of the VSP ticket management lifecycle. No users have reported any issues caused by this bug. The improved error handling code uses the new `Errors.Join` feature that was made available by updating to Go 1.20, which is discussed below.

Developer and internal changes merged in `master`:

Go 1.20 unlocked [better error handling](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.20#errors), which inspired a few changes:

- Removed an [unused variable](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2262) and a confusing [custom error function](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2263) from dcrwallet's internal errors definition.
- [Dropped support for Go 1.19](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2267), and bumped support to Go 1.20 and 1.21.0-rc3. This is because Go 1.19 doesn't have `Errors.Join`.
- Added the new [`Errors.Join`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2268) function from Go 1.20's standard library. This new function is a simple way to wrap several error messages together. In Go 1.19 and previous, it was somewhat possible with the `Errors.Is`/`As` functions, but wrapped errors could be hidden, which made error tracing quite difficult. `Errors.Join` is a [much better solution](https://blog.devgenius.io/wrapping-multiple-errors-in-go-1-20-78163ef5fc2c).

Additionally:

- Updated the [LRU cache](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2264) to use Go Generics and accept multiple variable types. LRU a standard caching schema which removes the Least Recently Updated values once the cache is full. The main advantage of a generic LRU cache is to reduce code duplication and unlock easier code reuse. This has the added benefit of more explicit code by specifying the types for each new LRU cache instance, as well as better code verification by the compiler. Generics were [added in Go 1.18](https://go.dev/blog/go1.18) (March 2022), and are relatively controversial, but only because they have tradeoffs that devs must consider. Ideally, the Go compiler would treat generic functions the same as it would treat functions with specific variable types, and each would be equally as optimized. In practice, this isn't always the case. The benefits of generics sometimes come at the cost of more complexity and [slightly slower performance](https://planetscale.com/blog/generics-can-make-your-go-code-slower). In this case, dcrwallet currently makes minimal use of generics, so the performance impact is minimal.
- Improved and polished [wallet tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2260), including removing redundant code.


### dcrctl

_[dcrctl](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl) is a command-line client for dcrd and dcrwallet._

The following work has been merged in `master` towards future releases:

- [Removed stale dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/pull/64) from the main module, and updated the [dcrd and dcrwallet modules](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/pull/67) to their latest versions. Notably, this makes dcrd's new verbose results of `getblock` and `getblockheader` available.
- Updated the README to recommend that developers use local [Go Workspaces](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/pull/66) when working with development versions of dcrd and dcrwallet.


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

In progress:

- Updating to [React v18](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3851)
- Ledger [backend functions](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3869) and [user interface](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3874)
- Updating [French](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3895) and [Chinese](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3893) translations

In July, @norwnd proposed a [2FA storage for Decrediton](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/15cyod5/decrediton_2fa_hoddle_safely/) based on simple 2-of-2 multisig. The idea is to provide a more secure solution for storing DCR by using a second device to sign transactions, initially an Android smartphone. This should protect from threats like a weak wallet encryption password or a stolen laptop. As a bonus it could make multisig features more accessible to regular users who don't have skills to program a multisig solution themselves. It is currently in early discussion and feedback phase but some effort has been made to test multisig features in dcrwallet and test how much data can be passed in QR codes.


### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software used by Voting Service Providers. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

Changes that were included in the [v1.2.1 release](https://github.com/decred/vspd/releases/tag/release-v1.2.1):

- Fixed [transaction broadcasting](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/398) logic to not generate an error when the transaction already exists (which is not a problem). This missing error condition was noticed when investigating the [broken retry](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2252) issue in dcrwallet's VSP client. It's a preventative fix, there have been no reported issues caused by this bug.


### Lightning Network

_[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant and low-cost transactions._

- Improved [tracking of closed channels](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/187). It's been observed on Decred LN mainnet that some channels that have been closed on-chain are still being announced on the network. While the root cause has not been determined, this change reduces the amount of invalid channel announcements and their negative effects, specially for nodes running in SPV mode (such as Bison Relay clients). This is implemented by saving channel IDs that are known to be closed and using that information to skip invalid updates or avoid expensive operations.


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

[Backported fixes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2432) to be included in the next v0.6 patch release:

- Server: [Increase order limits](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2411) as users lock more funds in bonds and ensure accounts with positive tier always have a positive order limit, big enough for at least a single lot. This should fix inability to submit orders for some users.
- Client: Ensure the server is aware that the client has [completed](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2405) the trade. In certain cases the client would fail to inform the server of a completed match, which could negatively affect account's reputation. With this fix the client will keep retrying the message until the server receives and acknowledges that the client has redeemed (received) the funds.
- Client: Updated [btcwallet and neutrino](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2438) dependencies to fix crashes in the built-in BTC wallet. Developers normally avoid upgrading dependencies in released versions to not introduce new bugs. This case is an exception however, considering the trouble caused by the bug, and that the next major release of DCRDEX is still quite far away.

Below are changes merged in `master` towards future releases.

Client:

- Improved [app setup flow](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2385). After setting app password the user will be shown Quick Configuration page that allows to enable DEX servers and select which wallets to activate. After that, a new page will remind the user to back up their app seed. Landing page shown after the setup has been changed to Wallets.
- [Switched](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2372) from WebView to [MacDriver](https://github.com/progrium/macdriver) library on macOS. This enables native macOS behavior like: keeping the app running without windows, creating new windows, and having a dock icon menu.
- Disallow [making transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2436) if the wallet is not synced and has no peers to sync from. This avoids transactions that never get mined and confuse users.
- Fixed misleading "Action required to trade" [startup message](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2428) asking the user to add more bonds. It could happen when bond transactions have not been sent yet and the user just needs to wait without taking any action.
- Fixed a bug where green triangle [markers for own orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2448) were not always shown on the depth chart.

Client, internal changes:

- Implemented function to place multiple orders in one go for [Decred](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2433), [Ethereum](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2421), and Ethereum token wallets. This will be used by the market making bots and may unlock trading optimizations.
- Refactoring and test code improvements.
- Updated [npm dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2439) to fix security warnings (affected packages were not used by the DEX at runtime).

Bitcoin, internal changes:

- Fixed bug in [coin selection](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2435) logic. It was not critical as it only affected the `MultiTrade` function, which is in not in production use yet.

Ethereum:

- Added [fiat values](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2427) to the token approval form. A one-time approval is required to allow the swap contract to handle tokens (such as USDC) on behalf of the user. Both granting and revoking this permission requires a small ETH transaction.

Highlights of work-in-progress:

- Decred: foundations for [DCR staking](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2290).
- Polygon: [infrastructure](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2431) work including USDC swap contract.
- Dash: [full node wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2424) support.
- Firo: [Electrum light wallet support](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2426).
- [Balance management](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2332) for market making bots.

### dcrdata

_[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata) is an explorer for Decred blockchain and off-chain data like Politeia proposals, markets, and more._

- Added the new BLAKE3 proof of work hash to the [block details page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1970). If dcrdata is running with a fairly new version of dcrd, it will [make use](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1971) of its [newly updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3154) `GetBlockHeader` command to obtain the PoW hash faster.


### Timestamply

_[Timestamply](https://github.com/decred/dcrtimegui) is a free service for timestamping files powered by Decred blockchain. A timestamp proves that a certain file has existed at a certain moment of time. This has a range of applications in protecting data integrity._

- Updated GitHub actions to [build with Go 1.20](https://github.com/decred/dcrtime/pull/91), as well as add linters and fix their complaints.
- The [JavaScript library](https://github.com/decred/dcrtimejs) for Decred timestamping, dcrtimejs, has been imported from its [original location](https://github.com/tiagoalvesdulce/dcrtimejs) to become a part of the [decred](https://github.com/decred/dcrtimejs) GitHub account. dcrtimejs v1.0.0 release has been funded by the treasury as a key element of the [Timestamply redesign](https://proposals.decred.org/record/855a506) proposal.


### Bison Relay

_[Bison Relay](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay) is a new social media platform with strong protections against censorship, surveillance, and advertising, powered by Decred Lightning Network._

GUI and CLI apps:

- Added `syncfreelist` config option to tune the bbolt database used by the internal Lightning Network node. Setting it to `false` improves running performance at the cost of startup performance.

GUI app:

- Improved post comments UX, now comment threads can be [collapsed or expanded](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/298).
- Fixed a bug where News Feed did not render [embedded images](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/296) and showed "--embed" code instead.

CLI app:

- Added basic [`/backup` command](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/297).
- Added [content filtering](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/265) system which can block messages from being displayed to the end user at the client level. To create a filtering rule the user needs to specify in what context it will work (direct chats, group chats, posts, post comments, or all) and what content it should match (can be simple strings or regular expressions). Try `/help filters add` and `/help filters addrule` to learn how it works. Currently, it is only exposed in the CLI app but the low level parts can be wired to GUI app in the future.


### Other

- All legacy VSPs (called "stakepools" back then) have been [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pull/158) from dcrwebapi, the service that powers Decrediton and the [VSP list](https://decred.org/vsp/) at decred.org. Legacy VSPs have been deprecated with the [release of vspd](https://blog.decred.org/2020/06/02/A-More-Private-Way-to-Stake/) in 2020 and all known public servers have shut down by around 2022.

## Governance

In July the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 7,859 DCR worth $121K at July's average rate of $15.40. 4,943 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $76K at same rate.

A [treasury spend tx](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/bf3fcf63697c2191260690aa8471088e863e4f25434564196f8110464b669a51) was approved with 5,274 Yes votes and 37% turnout, and mined on July 25. This one got 9 No votes, becoming the second TSpend out of 15 mined so far to have non-zero No votes. It had 32 outputs making payments to contractors, ranging from 1.5 DCR to 1,692 DCR. Most of this DCR was likely paid for May work, at its billing exchange rate of $17.13 the TSpend is worth around $85K.

As of Aug 6, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 865,895 DCR (12.6 million USD at $14.56).

## Ecosystem

Voting Service Providers:

- New VSP at [vote.dcr-swiss.ch](https://vote.dcr-swiss.ch/) has voted its first mainnet tickets and [applied](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pull/178) to get listed in Decrediton wallet and the [VSP page](https://decred.org/vsp/). DCR Swiss has a low fee of 0.25%. Out of 14 existing VSPs this is the third lowest fee after dcrhive.com (0.1%) and vspd.bass.cf (0.2%).

Wallets:

- Android and iOS Decred wallets will stop syncing in late August when new [consensus upgrades](https://voting.decred.org/) activate. The apps have been removed from Google Play and Apple Store to prevent users from installing apps that are no longer maintained. If you have used Android or iOS Decred wallets feel free to comment in a [Reddit survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/15eokjz/survey_have_you_used_decred_mobile_apps/).

Exchanges:

- EXMO [announced](https://info.exmo.me/ru/uvedomleniya/exmo-me-exclude-from-listing-five-crypto/) on July 6 that they will delist DCR and 3 other tokens by July 20 due to low liquidity. EXMO was the only exchange to list DCR via a non-expensive [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/950e8149e594b01c010c1199233ab11e82c9da39174ba375d286dc72bb0a54d7) that got approved in May 2019 and fulfilled in [June 2019](https://exmo.com/en/news_view?id=2776).

- #trading members [discovered](https://matrix.to/#/!lDZCzVQjFoJsXMPkvr:decred.org/$aTBeqNdAk4d03IEEybIk8WtVo-Wfe0JYFwVX0fZsIh4) on July 9 that DCR was trading around $20 at Indian [Bitbns](https://bitbns.com/trade/#/dcr) while it was around $16 on other exchanges. As of July 31 DCR was still trading at a premium and with significant 24-hour volume of $68K making DCR/INR a top 10 pair at Bitbns (if we trust reported volumes of course). DCR [price chart](https://bitbns.com/trade/#/dcr) suggests it was listed in May 2022.

Communication systems:

- Public access to Twitter has been mostly [unavailable](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/twitter-silently-removes-login-requirement-for-viewing-tweets/) between June 30 and July 5. Browsing Twitter required login and was subject to rate limits even for paid accounts. According to Elon Musk it was a [temporary emergency measure](https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-now-needs-users-sign-view-tweets-2023-06-30/) to combat AI bots which were pulling so much data from Twitter that it effectively became a denial of service attack. Public API restrictions also [broke Nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/issues/919), a lightweight alternative for browsing [@decredproject](https://nitter.net/decredproject) and other accounts. Login requirement was [removed](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/twitter-silently-removes-login-requirement-for-viewing-tweets/) on July 5. Despite all problems and [revelations](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1670117122650050561) Twitter remains Decred's main outreach platform with 53.3K followers as of Aug 1.

- The two-way bridge between Matrix and Discord is back! It was made possible by the new [user verification](202306.md#ecosystem) flow that is much better at preventing spam. The new bridge allows blocking individual Discord users on the Matrix side without affecting other Discord users, this was not possible with the old bridge. Also, message editing should propagate in both directions. New bridge is hosted by [t2bot.io](https://t2bot.io/discord/), a free service providing bots and bridges for [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) communities. It is operated by a single person and is supported by [donations](https://t2bot.io/donations/). As of writing the following Matrix rooms are bridged to Discord: #101, #dex, #marketing, #media, #memes, #proposals, #showerthoughts, #support, and of course #trading.

Other news:

- In May both [@StakeShuffle_](https://twitter.com/StakeShuffle_/status/1660015673102180353) and [@dcrtimestampbot](https://twitter.com/dcrtimestampbot/status/1660015663514107904) announced that the bots are "down until further notice due to recent twitter-api changes". The bots have been developed by @cli\_query and sponsored by a total of 3 low-budget [proposals](https://proposals.decred.org/user/3b9b30d5-1065-4e48-b1b6-3f558d0cb378?tab=submitted%20proposals). It appears that developer time is [limited](https://proposals.decred.org/record/1a290d8) to maintain these projects, but the Python source code of [StakeShuffle_](https://github.com/JC60522/StakeShuffle_BOT) and [dcrtimestampbot](https://github.com/JC60522/dcr_timestampbot) is available on GitHub for contributors to pick up and improve.

## Outreach

First iteration of the new multi-coin publication [Cypherpunk Times](https://cypherpunktimes.com/) is live! It is a continuation and a rebrand of Decred Magazine, approved and funded by Decred stakeholders in [July 2023](https://proposals.decred.org/record/4d3a8fc). The new social media handle is `@cypherpunktimes` on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cypherpunktimes), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/cypherpunktimes), and [Spotify podcasts](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/cypherpunktimes). Any support is greatly appreciated.

Firo is the first project to contribute content to Cypherpunk Times. In July Firo has [onboarded](https://matrix.to/#/!NkCFEoJGXyDMwLfgMb:decred.org/$hoWcufElq2WAw5RcQ2GM1pE2ASKDme8q9-RZTQfvv04) 3 content and published their first [article](https://www.cypherpunktimes.com/unveiling-spark-public-testnet-launch-date-confirmed/).

TikTok account `@decredmagazine` was renamed to [@dearcryptopunk](https://www.tiktok.com/@dearcryptopunk). Moving forward its scope will be extended from supporting Cypherpunk Times to general Decred outreach, and it will move under the umbrella of [Decred Vanguard](https://proposals.decred.org/record/0a1b782) proposal. Twitter account [@decredmagazine](https://twitter.com/decredmagazine) will keep running for now to support Decred-only content.

Totti from [BTC-ECHO](https://www.btc-echo.de/) has collected two rounds of feedback posted across [Politeia](https://proposals.decred.org/record/49e373b) and the [#writers](https://chat.decred.org/#/room/#writers:decred.org) chat and incorporated it in the first German article. BTC-ECHO [suggested](https://proposals.decred.org/record/49e373b/comments/30) to wait through the lower seasonal activity and publish the first article in mid-August. The delay was used to [add mentions](https://matrix.to/#/!NkCFEoJGXyDMwLfgMb:decred.org/$-Y8Sj1vafMV3bFwDTRyMavH9ab6ki2zntLvdmz6LBEw) of hardfork resistance and on-chain governance which are key to Decred consensus.

## Markets

In July DCR was trading between USDT 13.70-19.75 and BTC 0.00047-0.00064. The average daily rate was $15.40.

\#trading members [observed](https://matrix.to/#/!lDZCzVQjFoJsXMPkvr:decred.org/$qOBXWvgSgINClwaPNzI9IXoqu9BLuqZdmJic2qTwMLw) a $1 million sell wall on Binance DCR/USDT. Also, trading volumes across all markets were [unusually low](https://matrix.to/#/!lDZCzVQjFoJsXMPkvr:decred.org/$o6Rmw5-8oiHBwRIGWWnE3qMpJTXmm__ad7HoxyJVioo) on some days, possibly due to summer time.

## Relevant External

DeFi lending platform Curve, a pillar of DeFi on Ethereum, has been [hacked](https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1685693202722848768). The hack involved using a malfunctioning reentrancy lock in certain versions of Vyper which made certain pools but not others vulnerable to being drained. Similar protocols Metronome and Alchemix were also affected, and together the 3 projects [lost](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/04/looter-behind-61m-curve-hack-starts-returning-assets-raising-hope-for-recovery/) $61.7 million worth of assets. The attacker was only able to drain some of the affected pools because when the action started many white hat hackers stepped in to rescue their funds. By Aug 7 a reported 73% of the assets had been [recovered](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/07/curve-recoups-73-of-hacked-funds-bolstering-crv-sentiment/), some from the white hats but also significant amounts from the attacker. Curve offered a 10% bounty for voluntary return of funds until August 6, but with over $18 million still in the hacker's possession at the deadline the chance to end the matter there was lost and the bounty opened up to public investigators who could help to secure recovery.

Gitcoin has [launched](https://www.theblock.co/post/241425/gitcoins-layer-2-public-goods-network-goes-live-on-mainnet) an Ethereum Layer 2 called Public Goods Network (PGN), it uses the Optimism stack and a proportion of the sequencer fees will be collected in a pot to fund public goods.

Arkham Intelligence has launched a crypto identity data marketplace or "[doxx to earn program](https://protos.com/arkham-intelligence-draws-ire-for-dox-to-earn-program/)", where users can place bounties on the identity of certain crypto wallet addresses and eager researchers attempt to discover who owns the wallet for a pay day. Arkham also showed casual disregard for its own users by generating referral links using an easily reversed algorithm [revealing](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/10/crypto-startup-arkham-has-apparently-been-doxxing-privacy-obsessed-users-for-months/) the email addresses of the promoters. 

Sam Altman's Worldcoin [launched](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66128111) its eyeball-scanning orbs in 1,500 locations around the world, allowing people to scan their iris to set up a wallet and receive 25 free WLD (worth ~$50). The prospect of an AI company founder sending orbs out into the world to scan peoples' eyes for small handouts has been decried as dystopian by many in the crypto space, Worldcoin is not a popular project. However, Vitalik Buterin has recently published a blog [post](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/07/24/biometric.html) about biometric proof of personhood where he seems to find quite a lot of merit in Worldcoin's approach, suggesting it protects privacy better than most of the alternative approaches to proof of personhood, although still having some negative aspects. A day after Worldcoin's launch, the UK data watchdog was [reported](https://protos.com/worldcoin-eyed-by-uk-data-watchdog-day-after-launch-avoided-us/) to be looking into whether it complies with data protection regulations. In Kenya, where Worldcoin had been in communication with the Office of Data Protection Commissioner since April, it was thought to be operating legally but its scanning operations were [suspended](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/03/kenya-appears-to-have-flip-flopped-on-worldcoins-data-practices/) and it's not clear if this was self-imposed by Worldcoin to improve on "crowd control" issues with long lines at the sign-up stations, or if the authorities [changed](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/kenya-suspends-worldcoin-scans-over-security-privacy-and-financial-concerns/) their mind about its legality.

FedNow, the US government's instant payments system, [launched](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/21/fednow-is-finally-live-in-the-us/) with 35 financial  institutions set up to use the service which allows for 24/7 instant settlement.  This is seen as bridging a gap where the US is quite behind other jurisdictions that already have such instant bank transfer facilities. It is anticipated that it will take some time for uptake of FedNow by institutions to make the service broadly available to end users.

The Token Engineering Commons (TEC) has [completed](https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23) the first round of its new grants program, using Quadratic Funding (like Gitcoin grants) to distribute a funding pool of $25,000 and drawing donations of $6,162 to augment this and determine where the grants would go. TEC have added to the usual Quadratic Funding model (in which a greater number of individual donations to a project means a larger slice of the matching pool) by adding a mechanism for the expression of "Subject Matter Expertise". Contributors who had TEC tokens and/or NFT knowledge attestation certificates in their wallet were considered to be "experts" and a stronger weight was applied to their donations when determining the matching amount - this was done to tackle a perceived issue where projects that are good at mobilising community support do the best in Quadratic Funding rounds.

Legislation [concerning](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/28/us-stablecoin-bill-takes-big-step-despite-fight-from-democrats-white-house/) stablecoins has made it out of committee in the US Congress for the first time, meaning that should soon be voted on and if approved passed to the Senate. The bill had bipartisan support for some of its life but Democrats withdrew that support late in the process over a failure to negotiate a resolution to some points of conflict, lessening the bill's chances of making it all the way into law. One key point of dispute seems to be the role of a federal regulator to oversee stablecoins licensed at the state level, with Democrats pushing for this kind of oversight and Republicans rejecting it.

The much-hyped round of Bitcoin ETF applications from major financial institutions [incorporates](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/11/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-application-takes-surveillance-to-the-next-level/) a new feature, Surveillance Sharing Agreements (SSAs) with Coinbase as a provider of market intelligence where the ETF providers and regulators can pull data directly including the capacity to request personally identifiable information from Coinbase where this is deemed necessary to investigating or preventing market manipulation. In previous ETF filings the market provider would push information to regulators about suspicious activity, the SSAs turn this around to give more oversight. SSA with Coinbase was first introduced by BlackRock but has been copied by the other applicants in this round of ETF applications.

A European Commission document about its Metaverse strategy was [leaked](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/06/eus-leaked-metaverse-strategy-proposes-regulatory-sandbox-new-global-governance/) ahead of its publication. The document describes the potential of virtual worlds to being "unprecedented opportunities in many societal areas", and the need to remove barriers to new organizational forms such as DAOs to realise their benefits.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has [revealed](https://protos.com/sec-coinbase-demand-would-have-meant-end-of-crypto-in-the-us/) that shortly before suing them the SEC demanded that they drop all assets except Bitcoin, which made it an easy choice for the company to take the matter to court because that would have meant the effective end of their business in the US.

Binance's Australian headquarters has been [raided](https://protos.com/binance-australia-raided-by-regulator-just-weeks-after-europe-hq-raid/) by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), in an investigation into unlawful derivatives dealings that involved mislabelling retail and institutional customers. Binance also [withdrew](https://protos.com/binance-withdraws-germany-crypto-license-request-as-europe-bites-back/) its application for a license in Germany, after being told that it was not going to be granted in its current form. After Binance US lost its banking partner BTC has been trading at a [discount](https://protos.com/scoop-major-crypto-arbitrage-fund-says-binance-us-discounts-arent-worth-risk/), something similar happened in Australia in May.

Binance has completed [integrating](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-integration-bitcoin-btc-lightning-network) Bitcoin's Lightning Network.

The LBRY company has [shut down](https://decrypt.co/148288/lbry-token-plummets-file-sharing-crypto-project-shuts-down) after losing its case against the SEC, having its LBC token sales defined as unregistered securities offerings and being restricted from doing any more of this without first "registering with the SEC". The LBRY protocol lives on, it was never the target of the litigation, and the LBC token's status remains ambiguous as to whether it is now a security, since the SEC have bankrupted the incorporated "common enterprise" that token-holders were deemed to seek profit from.

Richard Heart, mastermind and primary beneficiary of the Hex and PulseChain projects, has been [sued](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/31/us-sec-sues-richard-heart-hex-pulsechain-on-unregistered-securities-fraud-allegations/) by the SEC for securities fraud violations. Although the Heart/Hex ecosystem is widely regarded as a scam, it has been [suggested](https://twitter.com/collins_belton/status/1686064809467396096) by [several](https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1686030110443315200) crypto legal personalities that the case doesn't seem very strong. The HEX terms referred to sacrificing money into a black box mechanism and Heart himself was very [clear](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tlFC_NhoRsQ) that he was spending a lot of the proceeds on designer clothes, portraying this as part of a marketing strategy which was going to help pump the price of the related tokens.

Alex Mashinsky, former CEO of Celsius, has been [arrested](https://protos.com/mashinsky-charged-by-doj-cftc-sec-and-ftc-year-on-from-celsius-bankruptcy/) and charged with a number of crimes including wire fraud and market manipulation. The Chief Revenue Officer was also charged. The filing indicates that Celsius was actively manipulating the price of CEL tokens while lying about key aspects of its performance, pumping and dumping the tokens to cash our large sums, $42 million allegedly in Mashinsky's case.

A [report](https://www.elliptic.co/hubfs/Elliptic_Report_Crypto%20and%20the%20Global%20Fentanyl%20Trade.pdf) by Elliptic researchers has identified Russian (Garantex) and Australian crypto exchanges as key intermediaries in facilitating the trade in Fentanyl precursors. They [identified](https://protos.com/centralized-crypto-exchanges-used-to-buy-32m-in-fentanyl-precursors-elliptic/) and communicated with over 100 sellers who were ready to ship Fentanyl or its precursor chemicals, and followed the crypto payment addresses to find out about their other transactions. In this way they uncovered addresses receiving $19M in Bitcoin and $13M in USDT, mostly from certain centralized exchanges.

Bittrex has [reminded](https://protos.com/bittrex-reminds-us-customers-to-withdraw-crypto-or-risk-unforeseen-issues/) its US customers to withdraw crypto assets from the bankrupt platform, they have until August 31st but Bittrex suggests doing it sooner rather than later for fear of "unforeseen issues". 

Blockchain technology broke new ground again in the realm of gambling, with the world's first live hamster racing [platform](https://hamsters.gg/) [launching](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/21/move-over-shiba-inu-crypto-community-flirts-with-hamster-race-betting/), where users can deposit ETH, BNB or BUSD and gamble it away betting on which hamster crosses the line first. Based on observation of several races (which are streamed on Twitch) the hamsters don't so much race as wander around (or not), showing very little interest in the finish line or motivation to get there first.
