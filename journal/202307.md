### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

The following work has been merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Updated `GetBlock` and `GetBlockHeader` commands to show [the new proof of work hash](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3154). For blocks after [DCP-11: Change PoW to BLAKE3 and ASERT](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0011/dcp-0011.mediawiki) activates, the *proof of work hash* will be the new BLAKE3 hash. For blocks prior to DCP-11, the *block hash* and the *proof of work hash* will be identical. This update enables consumers like [dcrdata](#dcrdata) to easily access the new hashes.
- Updated the [Docker image](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3158) to build the dcrd binary with newer Go and Alpine Linux. Node admins can consider Docker a good security option as opposed to using a virtual machine which has a much bigger attack surface.
- Updated the RPC server to [dynamically reload new RPC certificates](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3153) without shutting down and restarting. This is a quality-of-life improvement for node admins, since it enables them to hot-swap the server certificate/key pair, as well as any potential client certificates. This update is robust, minimizes disk access, does not require platform-specific dependencies, and is resilient against user-errors to avoid breaking a working config. { _What are some examples where this would be useful? Why would someone need to update their server cert, or client certs?_ }
- Explicitly configured RPC clients connecting to dcrd via HTTP to [use TLS v1.2 or higher](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3169). This was already the implicit minimum, but now it is more clear. { _Just in case: this is not breaking any code/scripts using `rpcclient` right?_ }

Developer and internal changes merged in `master`:

- Updated the comments detailing the [ASERT calculation coefficients](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3156) in the mining code so that they match the consensus code comments.
- Added a [new linter](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3157), addressed some [linter complaints](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3155), and moved [linting logic](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3161) to its own script outside of the testing script.
- Updated [Github Actions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3159), and ensured that the continuous integration actions happen in the [correct order](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3166).
- [Updated golangci-lint](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3163) to v1.53.3,  and changed its [method of installing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3162) from `curl` to `go install`, which has the benefit of reducing potential security risks from supply-chain attacks. Also cached the binary for faster future runs.
- Current versions of Go have a confusing way of handling loops. Both "for loops" and "range loops" treat internal loop variables ambiguously, which has led to code which is difficult to read and tricky to debug. Devs have had to treat loops with an abundance of caution, yet still potentially deal with annoying errors. A full explanation of the problem can be [read here](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/60078-loopvar.md), especially the section which talks about [the rationale](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/60078-loopvar.md#rationale-and-compatibility). Future versions of Go (likely 1.22) will introduce a breaking change to how loops are handled. While the new loop semantics will be less confusing and error-prone, projects will have to set a very high minimum supported Go version to avoid bugs when compiled with older Go. To ensure the dcrd code will work correctly with Go 1.22, as well as remain backwards-compatible and compile correctly with older versions of Go, [all necessary loops were updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3165). This will avoid any potential issues before they even have a chance to arise.


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

The following work has been merged in `master` towards future releases:

The primary improvements users may notice are related to purchasing tickets through a VSP:

- Fixed a [bug in the VSP client](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2269) where, if the wallet was closed after purchasing a ticket through a VSP, but before the VSP fee was paid, the fee payment could potentially be scheduled too far into the future (based on the ticket expiry date). Now, if the wallet is closed when purchasing a ticket before the VSP fee is paid, the VSP fee will be correctly scheduled to be paid the next time the wallet is opened - in a privacy-preserving way.
- Require VSP clients to [wait for the VSP to confirm fee payments](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2271) before considering a VSP ticket fully purchased. This eliminates multiple problematic edge cases, such as if the stake reward changed mid-purchase (causing the fee amount to not be enough), or if the payment was sent to the wrong address. This fix will improve the experience for users buying tickets through VSPs.
- Fixed a bug where some VSP tickets could be [skipped and not updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2266) during various stages of the VSP ticket management lifecycle. Improved error handling code uses the new `Errors.Join` feature that was made available by updating to Go 1.20, which is discussed below. { _ask jholdstock to understand the impact: (a) what negative effects were possible to the VSP tickets and (b) to how many tickets/users_ }

Developer and internal changes merged in `master`:

Go 1.20 unlocked [better error handling](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.20#errors), which inspired a few changes:

- Removed an [unused variable](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2262) and a confusing [custom error function](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2263) from dcrwallet's internal errors definition.
- [Dropped support for Go 1.19](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2267), and bumped support to Go 1.20 and 1.21.0-rc3. This is because Go 1.19 doesn't have `Errors.Join`.
- Added the new [`Errors.Join`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2268) function from Go 1.20's standard library. This new function is a simple way to wrap several error messages together. In Go 1.19 and previous, it was somewhat possible with the `Errors.Is`/`As` functions, but wrapped errors could be hidden, which made error tracing quite difficult. `Errors.Join` is a [much better solution](https://blog.devgenius.io/wrapping-multiple-errors-in-go-1-20-78163ef5fc2c).

Additionally:

- Updated the [LRU cache](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2264) (a standard caching schema which removes the Least Recently Updated (LRU) values once the cache is full) to use Go Generics and accept multiple variable types. The main advantage of a generic LRU cache function is to reduce code duplication and unlock easier code reuse. This has the added benefit of more explicit code by specifying the types with each new LRU cache, as well as better code verification by the compiler. Generics were [added in Go 1.18](https://go.dev/blog/go1.18) (March 2022), and are relatively controversial, but only because they have tradeoffs that devs must consider. Ideally, the Go compiler would treat generic functions the same as it would treat functions with specific variable types, and each would be equally as optimized. In practice, this isn't always the case. The benefits of generics sometimes come at the cost of more complexity and [slightly slower performance](https://planetscale.com/blog/generics-can-make-your-go-code-slower). In this case, dcrwallet currently only creates LRU caches when connecting with new peers, so the performance impact is minimal. { _but they are \*used\* more often than when connected, aren't generic function calls slower? if we are not certain about the per impact just remove the last sentence._ }
- Improved and polished [wallet tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2260), including removing redundant code.


### dcrctl

_[dcrctl](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl) is a command-line client for dcrd and dcrwallet._

The following work has been merged in `master` towards future releases:

- [Removed stale dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/pull/64) from the main module, and updated the [dcrd and dcrwallet modules](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/pull/67) to their latest versions. Notably, this makes dcrd's new verbose results of `getblock` and `getblockheader` available.
- Updated the README to recommend that developers use local [Go Workspaces](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl/pull/66) when working with development versions of dcrd and dcrwallet.


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

In July, @norwnd proposed a [2FA storage for Decrediton](https://gist.github.com/norwnd/890ad642985f4e9e9f7b1dd243b21f9e) based on simple 2-of-2 multisig. The idea is to provide a more secure solution for storing DCR by using a second device to sign transactions, initially an Android smartphone. This should protect from threats like a weak wallet encryption password or a stolen laptop. As a bonus it could make multisig features more accessible to regular users who don't have skills to program a multisig solution themselves. It is currently in early discussion and feedback phase but some effort has been made to test multisig features in dcrwallet and test how much data can be passed in QR codes.


### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software used by Voting Service Providers. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

Changes that were included in the [v1.2.1 release](https://github.com/decred/vspd/releases/tag/release-v1.2.1):

- Improved [transaction broadcasting](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/398) logic to not generate an error when the transaction already exists.
- { _intentionally omitting boring release notes updates in 399, 400_ }


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

{ _Sources:_

- #dexdev
- #dex

}

[Backported fixes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2432) to be included in the next v0.6 patch release:

- Server: [Increase order limits](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2411) as users lock more funds in bonds and ensure accounts with positive tier always have a positive order limit, big enough for at least a single lot. This should fix inability to submit orders for some users.
- Client: Ensure the server is aware that the client has [completed](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2405) the trade. In certain cases the client would fail to inform the server of a completed match, which could negatively affect account's reputation. With this fix the client will keep retrying the message until the server receives and acknowledges that the client has redeemed (received) the funds.
- Client: Updated [btcwallet and neutrino](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2438) dependencies to fix crashes in the built-in BTC wallet. Developers normally avoid upgrading dependencies in released versions to not introduce new bugs. This case is an exception however, considering the trouble caused by the bug, and that the next major release of DCRDEX is still quite far away.

Below are changes merged in `master` towards future releases.

Client:

- Improved [app setup flow](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2385). After setting app password the user will be shown Quick Configuration page that allows to enable DEX servers and select which wallets to activate. After that a new page will remind the user to backup app seed. Landing page shown after the setup has been changed to Wallets.
- [Switched](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2372) from WebView to [MacDriver](https://github.com/progrium/macdriver) library on macOS. This enables native macOS behaviors like: keeping the app running without windows, creating new windows, and having a dock icon menu.
- Disallow [making transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2436) if the wallet is not synced and has no peers to sync from. This avoids transactions that never get mined and confuse users.
- Fixed misleading "Action required to trade" [startup message](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2428) asking the user to add more bonds. It could happen when bond transactions have not been sent yet and the user just needs to wait without taking any action.
- Fixed a bug where green triangle [markers for own orders](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2448) were not always shown on the depth chart.

Client, internal changes:

- Implemented function to place multiple orders in one go for [Decred](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2433), [Ethereum](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2421), and Ethereum token wallets. This will be used by the market making bots and may unlock trading optimizations.
- Refactoring and test code improvements.
- Updated [npm dependencies](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2439) to fix security warnings (affected packages were not used by the DEX at runtime).

Bitcoin, internal changes:

- Fixed bug in [coin selection](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2435) logic. It was not critical as it only affected the `MultiTrade` function, which is in not in production use yet.

Ethereum:

- Added [fiat values](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2427) to the token approval form. A one-time approval is required to allow the swap contract to handle tokens (such as USDC) on behalf of the user. Both granting and revoking this permission requires a small ETH transaction.

In progress highlights:

- Decred: foundations for [DCR staking](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2290).
- Polygon: [infrastructure](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2431) work including USDC swap contract.
- Dash: [full node wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2424) support.
- Firo: [Electrum light wallet support](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2426).
- [Balance management](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2332) for market making bots.

### dcrdata

_[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata) is an explorer for Decred blockchain and off-chain data like Politeia proposals, markets, and more._

- Added the new BLAKE3 proof of work hash to the [block details page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1970). If dcrdata is running with a fairly new version of dcrd it will [make use](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1971) of its [newly updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3154) `GetBlockHeader` command to obtain the PoW hash faster.


### Timestamply

_[Timestamply](https://github.com/decred/dcrtimegui) is a free service for timestamping files powered by Decred blockchain. A timestamp proves that a certain file has existed at a certain moment of time. This has a range of applications in protecting data integrity._

{ _Sources:_

- #timestamp

}

- Updated GitHub actions to [build with Go 1.20](https://github.com/decred/dcrtime/pull/91), as well as add linters and fix their complaints.
- The [JavaScript library](https://github.com/decred/dcrtimejs) for Decred timestamping, dcrtimejs, has been imported from its [original location](https://github.com/tiagoalvesdulce/dcrtimejs) to become a part of the [decred](https://github.com/decred/dcrtimejs) GitHub account. dcrtimejs v1.0.0 release has been funded by the treasury as a key part of the [Timestamply redesign](https://proposals.decred.org/record/855a506) proposal.


### Bison Relay

_[Bison Relay](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay) is a new social media platform with strong protections against censorship, surveillance, and advertising, powered by Decred Lightning Network._

{ _Sources:_

- #br

}

GUI and CLI apps:

- Added `syncfreelist` config option to tune the bbolt database used by the internal Lightning Network node. Setting it to `false` improves running performance at the cost of startup performance.

GUI app:

- Improved post comments UX, now comment threads can be [collapsed or expanded](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/298).
- Fixed a bug where News Feed did not render [embedded images](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/296) and showed "--embed" code instead.

CLI app:

- Added basic [`/backup` command](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/297).
- Added [content filtering](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/265) system which can block messages from being displayed to the end user at the client level. To create a filtering rule the user needs to specify in what context it will work (direct chats, group chats, posts, post comments, or all) and what content it should match (can be simple strings or regular expressions). Try `/help filters add` and `/help filters addrule` to learn how it works. Currently it is only exposed in the CLI app but the low level parts can be wired to GUI app in the future.

<a id="governance" />

## Governance

{ _Hint: Currently this is a mix of finances and governance. We may add the separate Finances section in the future._ }

In July the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 7,859 DCR worth $121K at July's average rate of $15.40. 4,943 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $76K at same rate.

A [treasury spend tx](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/bf3fcf63697c2191260690aa8471088e863e4f25434564196f8110464b669a51) was approved with 5,283 Yes votes and {}% turnout, and mined on July 25. It had 32 outputs making payments to contractors, ranging from 1.5 DCR to 1692 DCR. Most of this DCR was likely paid for May work, at its billing exchange rate of $17.13 the TSpend is worth around $85K.

{ _Other interesting facts/stories about the legacy or new treasury._ }

As of Aug 6, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 865,895 DCR (12.6 million USD at $14.56).

{ _Story ideas:_

- May 15 - SEC vs LBRY
  - "last filing" something due May 26
  - https://twitter.com/CryptoLawUS/status/1658103828321914883
    - revoke $22M fine but still dealing damage?
  - Jun 11 https://twitter.com/LBRYcom/status/1667895132333416455
  - rr: this was a case of acknowledging that the fine was overkill and LBRY was never going to be able to pay, they reduced it in May and the company is still dead, but the news seems to have taken until July to [drop](https://decrypt.co/148288/lbry-token-plummets-file-sharing-crypto-project-shuts-down) so maybe we leave it until then? the Jun tweet above is the kind of whining about SEC that account has been doing for months/years :)

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has [revealed](https://protos.com/sec-coinbase-demand-would-have-meant-end-of-crypto-in-the-us/) that shortly before suing them the SEC demanded that they drop all assets except Bitcoin, which made it an easy choice for the company to take the matter to court because that would have meant the effective end of their business in the US.

Binance's Australian headquarters has been [raided](https://protos.com/binance-australia-raided-by-regulator-just-weeks-after-europe-hq-raid/) by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), in an investigation into unlawful derivatives dealings that involved mislabelling retail and institutional customers. Binance also [withdrew](https://protos.com/binance-withdraws-germany-crypto-license-request-as-europe-bites-back/) its application for a license in Germany, after being told that it was not going to be granted in its current form. After Binance US lost its banking partner BTC has been trading at a [discount](https://protos.com/scoop-major-crypto-arbitrage-fund-says-binance-us-discounts-arent-worth-risk/), something similar happened in Australia in May.

Binance has completed [integrating](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-integration-bitcoin-btc-lightning-network) Bitcoin's Lightning Network.

DeFi lending platform Curve, a pillar of DeFi on Ethereum, has been [hacked](https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1685693202722848768). The hack involved using a malfunctioning reentrancy lock in certain versions of Vyper which made certain pools but not others vulnerable to being drained. Similar protocols Metronome and Alchemix were also affected, and together the 3 projects [lost](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/04/looter-behind-61m-curve-hack-starts-returning-assets-raising-hope-for-recovery/) $61.7 million worth of assets. The attacker was only able to drain some of the affected pools because when the action started many white hat hackers stepped in to rescue their funds. By Aug 7 a reported 73% of the assets had been [recovered](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/07/curve-recoups-73-of-hacked-funds-bolstering-crv-sentiment/), some from the white hats but also significant amounts from the attacker. Curve offered a 10% bounty for voluntary return of funds until August 6, but with over $18 million still in the hacker's possession at the deadline the chance to end the matter there was lost and the bounty opened up to public investigators who could help to secure recovery.

Richard Heart, mastermind and primary beneficiary of the Hex and PulseChain projects, has been [sued](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/31/us-sec-sues-richard-heart-hex-pulsechain-on-unregistered-securities-fraud-allegations/) by the SEC for securities fraud violations. Although the Heart/Hex ecosystem is widely regarded as a scam, it has been [suggested](https://twitter.com/collins_belton/status/1686064809467396096) by [several](https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1686030110443315200) crypto legal personalities that the case doesn't seem very strong. The HEX terms referred to sacrificing money into a black box mechanism and Heart himself was very [clear](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tlFC_NhoRsQ) that he was spending a lot of the proceeds on designer clothes, portraying this as part of a marketing strategy which was going to help pump the price of the related tokens.

Gitcoin has [launched](https://www.theblock.co/post/241425/gitcoins-layer-2-public-goods-network-goes-live-on-mainnet) an Ethereum Layer 2 called Public Goods Network (PGN), it uses the Optimism stack and a proportion of the sequencer fees will be collected in a pot to fund public goods.

A [report](https://www.elliptic.co/hubfs/Elliptic_Report_Crypto%20and%20the%20Global%20Fentanyl%20Trade.pdf) by Elliptic researchers has identified Russian (Garantex) and Australian crypto exchanges as key intermediaries in facilitating the trade in Fentanyl precursors. They [identified](https://protos.com/centralized-crypto-exchanges-used-to-buy-32m-in-fentanyl-precursors-elliptic/) and communicated with over 100 sellers who were ready to ship Fentanyl or its precursor chemicals, and followed the crypto payment addresses to find out about their other transactions. In this way they uncovered addreses receiving $19M in Bitcoin and $13M in USDT, mostly from certain centralized exchanges.

Arkham Intelligence has launched a crypto identity data marketplace or "[doxx to earn program](https://protos.com/arkham-intelligence-draws-ire-for-dox-to-earn-program/)", where users can place bounties on the identity of certain crypto wallet addresses and eager researchers attempt to discover who owns the wallet for a pay day. Arkham also showed casual disregard for its own users by generating referral links using an easily reversed algorithm [revealing](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/10/crypto-startup-arkham-has-apparently-been-doxxing-privacy-obsessed-users-for-months/) the email addresses of the promoters. 

Bittrex has [reminded](https://protos.com/bittrex-reminds-us-customers-to-withdraw-crypto-or-risk-unforeseen-issues/) its US customers to withdraw crypto assets from the bankrupt platform, they have until August 31st but Bittrex suggests doing it sooner rather than later for fear of "unforeseen issues".
