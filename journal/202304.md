Client changes merged in v0.6.0 release:

- Do not put API server's address to Content Security Policy (CSP) HTTP header if it is an [IPv6 address](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2287). This is a fix for a workaround for a [Safari bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201591) that resulted some icons [not loading](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1652) properly.
- Fixed logging. { _d163705, group_ }
- Fixed potential integer [overflow](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2285) when calculating Ethereum transaction confirmations.
- Fixed [wrong color](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2279) of price change percentage label. { _may group_ }

All other changes below are merged in `master` towards future releases.

Client: { _maybe further split into user-facing and internal_ }

- Log an error when failing to [re-parse HTML template](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2291). This feature is used by developers for quick iterations on pages. { _group_ }
- Show a notification when [failing to connect](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2288) to a wallet.
- Default to using [`127.0.0.1`](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2283) IPv4 address when it is not specified in the config. This helps to satisfy the [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) protocol in a way that also work-arounds a bug in Safari. The new default avoids an issue where some [icons](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1652) are not loading properly because of CSP failures. { _follow-up fix in 2295; simplify and/or group_ }
- Added [release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2276) for v0.6.0.
- Always show market's [recent matches](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2307). Previously the Recent Matches list was cleared in some situations like restarting the client.
- Show [order rate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2281) in the collapsed order view. Rate (price) is an important info that must be visible without having to click to expand order details.
- Removed excess [trailing zeroes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2278) from some UI elements and improved overall consistency of number formatting.
- Remember last selected [candle size](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2284) across page reloads. Default candle size changed from 5 min to 1 hour.
- Track confirmations for the [redeem transaction](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2049) and retry it if necessary. This is addressing an edge case when the mempool is so full that transactions paying lower fees are purged and never mined. Such transactions must be retried later, possibly with a higher fee.
- Improved logging { 2314 2318 }
- Fixed market [prices](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2280) on the left sidebar going out of sync. { _may group_ }
- Fixed handling of server [notifications](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2286) that may come before client's markets are initialized.
- Fixed some [asset icons](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2310) getting removed on the Markets page. { _group_ }
- Fixed buy/sell [bar indicator](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2313) color and the missing "active" indicator (green dot) on orders that are in progress. { _group with UI fixes or something_ }
- Fixed error during [shutdown](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2325) when running in Decrediton.

Ethereum:

- Show more meaningful [Walle Type](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2207) like "RPC" for ETH wallets powered by 3rd party data providers and "Ethereum token" for USDC wallets.
- Updated [docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2289): Removed ArchiveNode.io provider which is shutting down, advised against using Flashbots.net, added Wallet Recovery tips.
- Refactored code for [rotating bonds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2275) to integrate ETH bonds more easily.
- Changed to broadcast transactions to [all RPC providers](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2266) instead of only one preferred provider. This should help ensure the transactions quickly propagate and are mined.
- Added [config guide link](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2261) to forms related to wallet setup. Also two fields will be shown for RPC providers instead of one. It is important that users understand that provider's failure may lead to loss of funds, and confugire 2 or more providers to always have a fallback.
- Added a developer tool for getting [gas estimates](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2050) for DEX-critical operations on Ethereum. It will help to add new tokens or new contract versions.

Litecoin:

- Ported [transaction size fixes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2299) from [ltcd](https://github.com/ltcsuite/ltcd/pull/25) to handle some unusually large SegWit transactions.
- Some MimbleWimble [decoder code](https://github.com/ltcsuite/ltcd/issues/17#issuecomment-1201877368) written for DCRDEX has been [adopted](https://github.com/ltcsuite/ltcd/issues/17#issuecomment-1506234416) in [ltcd](https://github.com/ltcsuite/ltcd/pull/31).

Zcash:

- Replaced usages of [deprecated address methods](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2237) for Zcash. This requires zcashd v5.4.2 or newer.
- Added [initial](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2317) [infrastructure](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2250) for shielded pools, a Zcash feature enabling private balances and transactions. First stage of Zcash privacy integration will be limited to shielding/unshielding own funds, and sending from own shielded to arbitrary shielded or transparent addresses. Only transparent addresses will be involved in swap activity.
- Fixed spelling of [Zcash](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2300) across the codebase.
- Fixed ZEC wallet [creation form](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2329). { _group_ }

DigiByte:

- DigiByte swaps have been tested on [mainnet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1993#issuecomment-1487571640), DGB support has been [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1993) and may be [released](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1993#issuecomment-1511304826) in the upcoming v0.6.1.
- Running a DigiByte full node is currently the only option since it is based on Bitcoin Core v0.17 and has no [compact filters](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1992#issue-1486990539) support (so DEX cannot implement a built-in DGB wallet). A big upgrade to Bitcoin Core v22 features is [in progress](https://github.com/DigiByte-Core/digibyte/pull/63) so this may change in the future.
- For some background, DGB community members expressed interest back in November 2022 and have been [active](https://twitter.com/JohnnyLaw2021/status/1587801707790180353) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dgb_ycagel/status/1599944772403466241) and DEX's [GitHub](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1993#issuecomment-1459097459). @chappjc created a [patch](https://github.com/DigiByte-Core/digibyte/pull/102) that improves DigiByte node's performance testnet to facilitate. In March 2023 Decred stakeholders approved DGB integration as part of the latest [DEX development proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/ca6b749).
- Note that this stage is just software support in DCRDEX, getting DGB markets up and running is a [separate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1993#issuecomment-1456932743) task.

Server:

- Removed server startup requirement of having [DCR registration fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2293) configured, and removed code strictly tied to DCR fees. This old code was made obsolete by the ability to pay the registration fee in any asset supporting it. Now with the transition to fidelity bonds the multi-asset registration fee support is itself deprecated, but it will remain available for some time.
- Fixed handling of client requests that come [too quickly](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2229) after a swap error is returned to the client. { _may group_ }
- Fixed startup [balance check](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2312) bug that could erroneously unbook an order.

Internal and developer changes:

- Improved [domain parsing](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2277) utility to apply in more use cases. { _may group with refactoring_ }
- Refactored connection logic to remove a Go [anti-pattern](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2124) where both a non-empty result and non-empty error are returned and the caller needs to check both.
- Adjusted [Docker build](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2309) workflow to trigger more reliably when the release is published and to allow the manual triggering. { _may simplify and group_ }
- Introduced [`asset.Authenticator`](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2069) interface for wallets that require authentication (password entry). This gives various parts of the codebase a cleaner access to unlock and lock methods for wallet operations that require it.
- Removed duplicate code { 2226 }
- Fixed building of the Windows binary with [system tray](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2311) support.
- Test fixes { 2294 }

Other:

- v0.6.0 comes with an experimental market maker bot that can be used to add liquidity to DEX markets. Use with care https://matrix.to/#/!teQafvHMYpIbqLIieU:decred.org/$kwxP2tbfEC-kcId2mpl4RIa1A-gMEaVqnFNwG44fmck
- Some of the [fixes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2323) listed above will be backported to the upcoming v0.6.1 release.
- Litecoin users are advised to upgrade their nodes to v0.21 https://twitter.com/chappjc/status/1645982431571329024
- Umbrel integration: Decred's Umbrel Community App Store has been [updated](https://github.com/decred/umbrel-app-store/pull/3) with the latest Docker image including DEX v0.6.0 release. Umbrel installation links have been [added](https://github.com/decred/dexweb/pull/34) to [dex.decred.org](https://dex.decred.org/). Finally, DEX v0.6 release on Umbrel has been [announced](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1648439889678192640) on Twitter.

In progress:

- [DCR staking](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2264) directly in the DEX wallet. This has triggered an effort to [extract more VSP code](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/382) from dcrwallet to the vspd repository to make it easier to reuse.
- Market maker bot. This is a big effort involving tasks like [command-line interface](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2304), [testing framework](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2303) simulating various market conditions, [trade performance monitoring](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2306), [segregating bot's balances](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2332)
- [Arbitrage bot](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2005) (part of the [DEX bots proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/8b1ceda)).
- Packaging DEX as a [desktop app](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1957). This will wrap the GUI in a [WebView](https://github.com/webview/webview) browser so the DEX will behave like a normal desktop app with its own window, taskbar/tray icon, notifications, etc. without having to load it in a regular browser. This is part of the [packaging proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/ae7c4fe). Specialized packages for [Debian](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2308) and [macOS](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2333) are also in progress. Testers wanted! Join the [#dexdev](https://chat.decred.org/#/room/#dexdev:decred.org) chat and ask how to participate.
- [Polygon integration](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2319) (part of the [client dev proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/ca6b749)). Polygon is a new name for Matic Network.
- New version of ETH [smart contract for swaps](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2038) which has potential to significantly [reduce fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1426).
- Fidelity bonds funded in [ETH](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2223).
- Initial research to integrate [Firo](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2270) (formerly known as Zcoin) has started.

## Governance

{ _Hint: Currently this is a mix of finances and governance. We may add the separate Finances section in the future._ }

In April the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received {n} DCR worth ${} at April's average rate of ${}. {} DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth ${} at April's average rate.

A [treasury spend tx](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/5aa2142e4dce72d28fb3cef3e7d1b565a90655304fdd284016fb585cc96431e9) was approved with 6,900 Yes votes and 54% turnout, and mined on Apr 16. It had {} outputs making payments to contractors, ranging from {} DCR to {} DCR. Most of this DCR was likely paid for February work, at its billing exchange rate of $24.03 the TSpend is worth around ${}.

{ _Other interesting facts/stories about the legacy or new treasury._ }

As of {date}, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is {n} DCR ({n} million USD at ${n.nn}).

## Network

{

- _Hint: "Network" tracks key "health" metrics of the fundamental infrastructure._
- _Hint: `n`, `n.n`, and `n.nn` tell how many decimals to keep, e.g. 100, 16.5, 8.63_

}

**Hashrate**: April's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of {} Ph/s hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

{ _Hint: Fallback links for pool distribution: https://poolbay.io/crypto/54/decred , https://dcrstats.com/pow ._ }

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between {n}-{n} DCR.
