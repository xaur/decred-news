## Core Software v1.7.7 Release

Highlights of the [v1.7.7 release](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1648190102802161671):

- **dcrd** got a few optimizations to use a bit less traffic and CPU in certain scenarios.

- **dcrwallet** got many bug fixes and performance improvements for SPV mode, ticket buying, and mixing. In particular, this benefits heavily-used wallets that contain many transactions.

- **Decrediton** gained voting for individual TSpend transactions, redesigned launcher views that educate the user while the wallet is loading, redesigned Trezor views, an upgrade to DCRDEX v0.6.0 with ETH and USDC trading, and a number of bug fixes.

Visit the [GitHub release](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases) for the full list of changes and downloads. As always, we recommend to [verify the files](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/verifying-binaries) before running.


## DCRDEX v0.6.0 Release

The long-awated v0.6 has shipped around 8 months of development work. Major changes since v0.5:

- ETH and ERC-20 wallets and trading
- Built-in light wallets for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) allow to store and trade funds without running full nodes
- Registration fee is replaced with fidelity bonds, time-locked funds that can be returned back to the user
- Ability to connect to a DEX server in view-only mode
- Restyled Markets and Wallets pages with different layouts for various screen sizes
- Experimental market maker bot

Other notable changes:

- Manual peer management controls
- Fee estimates on Send pages
- Ability to disable an existing wallet
- Archiving of older order data
- Snappier order placement
- Recent matches shown on the Markets page
- Numerous improvements and fixes in Electrum support, Ethereum support, order tracking and presentation, error reporting, fee estimation, translations, and more

There are 3 ways to obtain DCRDEX:

- As part of the [Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases) wallet
- Standalone `dexc` app from [core software release](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases) (more CPU and OS options, signed by `Decred Release` key)
- Standalone `dexc` app from [DCRDEX's own release](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases) (has Windows build with no terminal window and system tray icon, signed by DEX developers)

Please take the time to read [Important Notices](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.6.0) to learn about specifics of non-custodial P2P trading.

Tip: Built-in LTC wallet can be slow to get started as it searches for a node that supports compact block filters. Users can go to DEX wallet page, click Litecoin -> Settings -> Manage Peers, and manually add one peer [from this list](https://gist.github.com/chappjc/d0f26b12258f8531bb78b37f38d080a0) to help boostrap the process.


## Bison Relay v0.1.7 Release

New release has landed just 4 weeks since v0.1.6 RC1. Notable changes in v0.1.7 final:

- Improved onboarding flows thanks to new prepaid invites, server-based invites, and automated wallet setup
- Right-clicking a username opens a menu with tipping and other useful commands
- Button to suggest a user to exchange keys with another user (i.e. introduce one to another)
- UI notifications for new posts and new comments to existing posts
- Improved and fixed scrolling behavior
- Listing of all own posts
- Better UX for adding files to posts
- Received files can be opened from BR
- macOS app is signed and notarized
- More details in the [Bison Relay](#bison-relay) Development section

{ _^unlike the dev logs these are sorted by importance/impact_ }

Get the latest release binaries on [GitHub](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/releases). Bison Relay downloads can now be [verified](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/verifying-binaries) thanks to the added signatures made by the same key that signs Decred releases (`Decred Release <release@decred.org>` with fingerprint `F516ADB7A069852C7C28A02D6D897EDF518A031D`).


## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Past changes backported to [v1.7.7 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/releases/tag/release-v1.7.7):

- Increased minimum Go version to 1.17 for [`peer`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/0d375e0738e5995b1c3beb303a654aefe76e4a64) and [`addrmgr`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/235233906177b5c429f0e1297cc05bafb9d60b15) modules to enable Go toolchain optimizations like [module graph pruning](https://go.dev/ref/mod#graph-pruning) and [lazy module loading](https://go.dev/ref/mod#lazy-loading).
- Increased version of the peer-to-peer [protocol](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/ad501373e203aeff56e8f7f699ab442f8706694e) used by the `peer` module to no longer use the `reject` message (we explained it in the [November](202211.md#dcrd) issue).
- Fixed caching of other peers' [inventory](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3074) (small traffic optimization).
- Optimized [peer address selection](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/32e98be286deb3104352f81fe8c1147c1f158e29) and mitigated excessive CPU usage in testnet scenarios.
- Updated code formatting, build scripts and README for [Go 1.20](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3087).
- Updated to latest `sys` module (low-level interaction with the operating system) to support building on OpenBSD with 64-bit [RISC-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V) processors.
- All backported changes have been added to the [release branch](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commits/release-v1.7) as opposed to just increasing module version numbers in the `go.mod` file. This makes building from the release branch more [easier](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3083) for some developers.
- Background: the [`peer`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/8f3e249555544ff8f1991d055da1e910dbd5a88b/peer) and [`addrmgr`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/8f3e249555544ff8f1991d055da1e910dbd5a88b/addrmgr) modules provide a solid foundation for building software that talks to the Decred network. { _optional edu bit, may drop_ }

Changes merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Added definitions for the upcoming consensus votes to change the [proof-of-work hashing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3089) to [BLAKE3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)#BLAKE3) and to [reduce PoW block rewards](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3090). These changes will be documented more formally in [Decred Change Proposals](https://github.com/decred/dcps) DCP-11 and DCP-12, respectively. The definitions only add basic information like vote description, choices, and validity dates. Code implementing the real changes will be added separately.
- Implemented the [DCP-12 consensus vote](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3092). If it passes, block reward split will change to 1% PoW, 89% PoS, 10% Treasury.
- Added a function for [generating a private key](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3096) using a custom source of entropy. Having such function in dcrd allows to remove duplication from other Decred packages. { _follow-up in 3097 and 3100 - drop after review_ }
- Test and logging code refactoring { _3104 3105 3107 3108 - drop after review_ }
- Cleanup { _3106 - drop after review_ }
- Versions of several modules have been bumped to enable Go's module graph pruning across the codebase.


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

Changes backported to v1.7.7 release:

- Added [`watchlast` option](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2196) to limit initially watched addresses, which benefits large wallets with many old addresses.
- Removed needless [balance calculation](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2203) when using the ticket auto buyer. This improves performance for more active wallets.
- Fixed an edge case where ticket purchasing is cancelled due to a change of the ticket price, leading to some wallet's transactions [not being discovered](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2212).
- Implemented a faster way to [select random UTXOs](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2202) (aka "coins") used to create new transactions.
- Avoid creating [small mix change](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2218) so that the unmixed account is not filled with these outputs that are too small to mix, and too tempting to spend together. Instead of creating such small outputs, their value is rolled into the transaction fee.

{ v1.7.7 rel notes read differently, like the small outputs *are* entering mixes but not exiting them, i.e. left to miners as tx fee:

> Mixed ticket buying and account mixing no longer creates change that is smaller than the minimum amount needed to mix a UTXO at the smallest common demonination during change account mixing. Previously, change that was too small to mix was only discarded (i.e. included in the transaction fee) during mixing at the smallest common denomination.

}

Changes merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Cleaned up and simplified public API of internal [VSP code](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2227). This is part of consolidating VSP code in the [vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) repository for easier maintenance and code reuse.
- Removed [ticket revocation](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2230) from VSP client. This removes a significant dependency from the VSP code, and it is unnecessary anyway because revocations are automatic since [DCP-9](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0009/dcp-0009.mediawiki).
- Fixed configured [max VSP fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2228) not being respected and always overridden with the hard-coded value of 0.2 DCR. Also, VSP config validation has been moved to startup code so that invalid options are reported earlier.
- Concurrency fixes { 2229 }
- Maintenance { 2219 2231 - _may group or drop_ }


### dcrctl

_[dcrctl](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl) is a command-line client for dcrd and dcrwallet._

- Updates for the v1.7.7 release: switch to latest GitHub build code, Go 1.20, and use latest dcrwallet code.


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

Changes backported to v1.7.7 release:

- ~34 [commits](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/release-v1.7.6...release-v1.7.7) with all fixes and improvements made since [November 2022](202211.md#decrediton).
- Updated to include [DCRDEX v0.6.0](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3857).
- Fixed a bug on the [Send form](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3855) that caused wrong DCR amount to be reported or sent in some scenarios.
- Fixed delay when [opening wallet](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3846) by removing the unnecessary fetching of VSP info.
- Fixed [loading status](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3846) on Process Managed/Unmanaged Tickets views and added tests for them. These views help to ensure that all tickets are registered with VSPs and fees are paid.
- Fixed [ETH showing as not supported](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3861) in the DEX window. Release [binaries](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.7.7) were quickly rebuilt to include this fix.

See the [release notes](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.7.7#decrediton-v177) for a summary of all changes since v1.7.6.

{ image candidates: 3857 (but it's a DEX window shot, we'll have more of those below) }


### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software used by Voting Service Providers. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

- Updated to latest [Decred modules](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/378) from dcrd and dcrwallet.
- Code maintenance. { 376 381 383 }

### Lightning Network

_[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant and low-cost transactions._

- Backported a [change](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5047) from upstream lnd to bring [account-related functions](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/178) (import account, import a single public key, list accounts, etc.). On top of that a few more features have been added: creating additional wallet accounts, exporting individual private keys, and spending specific UTXOs. The goal for these changes is to allow users to create an account from which individual private keys may be extracted and then spent. This is used in Bison Relay for funding prepaid invites.
- Updated to latest [Decred modules](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/179) from dcrd and dcrwallet.
- Added RPC request for getting information about a [transaction](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/180) that belongs to LN wallet.


### cspp

_[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp) is a server for coordinating coin mixes using the CoinShuffle++ protocol. It is non-custodial, i.e. never holds any funds. CSPP is part of StakeShuffle, Decreds privacy system._

- Project Lead Jake Yocom-Piatt reports [peer-to-peer mixing](https://twitter.com/exitusdcr/status/1655095852392935425) will eventually replace the central server that coordinates mixes.


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

Client changes merged in v0.6.0 release:

- Do not put API server's address to Content Security Policy (CSP) HTTP header if it is an [IPv6 address](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2287). This is a fix for a workaround for a [Safari bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201591) that resulted some in icons [not loading](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1652) properly.
- Fixed logging. { _d163705, group_ }
- Fixed potential integer [overflow](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2285) when calculating Ethereum transaction confirmations.
- Fixed [wrong color](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2279) of price change percentage labels. { _may group_ }

All other changes below are merged in `master` towards future releases.

Client: { _maybe further split into user-facing and internal_ }

- Log an error when failing to [re-parse HTML template](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2291). This feature is used by developers for iterating pages quickly. { _group_ }
- Show a notification when [failing to connect](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2288) to a wallet.
- Default to using [`127.0.0.1`](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2283) IPv4 address when it is not specified in the config. This helps to satisfy the [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) protocol in a way that also work-arounds a bug in Safari. The new default avoids an issue where some [icons](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1652) are not loading properly because of CSP failures. { _follow-up fix in 2295; simplify and/or group_ }
- Added [release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2276) for v0.6.0.
- Always show market's [recent matches](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2307). Previously the Recent Matches list was cleared in some situations like restarting the client.
- Show [order rate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2281) even if the order box is collapsed. Rate (price) is an important info that must be visible without having to click to expand order details.
- Removed excess [trailing zeroes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2278) from some UI elements and improved overall consistency of number formatting.
- Remember last selected [candle size](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2284) across page reloads. Default candle size changed from 5 min to 1 hour.
- Track confirmations for the [redeem transaction](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2049) and retry it if necessary. This is addressing an edge case when the mempool is so full that transactions paying lower fees are purged and never mined. Such transactions must be retried later, possibly with a higher fee.
- Improved logging { 2314 2318 }
- Fixed market [prices](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2280) on the left sidebar getting out of sync. { _may group_ }
- Fixed handling of server [notifications](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2286) that may come before client's markets are initialized.
- Fixed some [asset icons](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2310) getting removed from the Markets page. { _group_ }
- Fixed buy/sell [bar indicator](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2313) color and the missing "active" indicator (green dot) on orders that are in progress. { _group with UI fixes or something_ }
- Fixed error during [shutdown](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2325) when running in Decrediton.

Ethereum:

- Show more meaningful [Walle Types](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2207) such as "RPC" for ETH wallets powered by 3rd party data providers and "Ethereum token" for USDC wallets.
- Updated [docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2289): Removed ArchiveNode.io provider which is shutting down, advised against using Flashbots.net, added Wallet Recovery tips.
- Refactored code for [rotating bonds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2275) to integrate ETH bonds more easily.
- Changed to broadcast transactions to [all RPC providers](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2266) instead of only one preferred provider. This should help ensure the transactions quickly propagate and are mined.
- Added [config guide link](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2261) to forms related to wallet setup. Also two input fields will be shown for RPC providers instead of one. It is important that users understand that provider's failure may lead to loss of funds, and confugire 2 or more providers to always have a fallback.
- Added a developer tool for getting [gas estimates](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2050) for DEX-critical operations on Ethereum. It will help to add new tokens or new contract versions.

Litecoin:

- Ported [transaction size fixes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2299) from [ltcd](https://github.com/ltcsuite/ltcd/pull/25) to handle some unusually large SegWit transactions.
- Some MimbleWimble [decoder code](https://github.com/ltcsuite/ltcd/issues/17#issuecomment-1201877368) written for DCRDEX has been [adopted](https://github.com/ltcsuite/ltcd/issues/17#issuecomment-1506234416) in [ltcd](https://github.com/ltcsuite/ltcd/pull/31)!

Zcash:

- Replaced usages of [deprecated address methods](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2237) for Zcash. This requires zcashd v5.4.2 or newer.
- Added [initial](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2317) [infrastructure](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2250) for shielded pools, a Zcash feature enabling private balances and transactions. First stage of Zcash privacy integration will be limited to shielding/unshielding own funds, and sending from own shielded to arbitrary shielded or transparent addresses. Only transparent addresses will be involved in swap activity initially.
- Fixed spelling of [Zcash](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2300) across the codebase.
- Fixed ZEC wallet [creation form](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2329). { _group_ }

DigiByte:

- DigiByte swaps have been tested on [mainnet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1993#issuecomment-1487571640), DGB support has been [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1993) and is [planned](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1993#issuecomment-1511304826) for the upcoming v0.6.1.
- Running a DigiByte full node is currently the only option since it is based on Bitcoin Core v0.17 and has no [compact filters](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1992#issue-1486990539) support (so DEX cannot implement a lightweight built-in DGB wallet). A big upgrade to Bitcoin Core v22 features is [in progress](https://github.com/DigiByte-Core/digibyte/pull/63) so this may change in the future.
- For some background, DGB community members expressed interest back in November 2022 and have been [active](https://twitter.com/JohnnyLaw2021/status/1587801707790180353) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dgb_ycagel/status/1599944772403466241) and DEX's [GitHub](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1993#issuecomment-1459097459). @chappjc created a [patch](https://github.com/DigiByte-Core/digibyte/pull/102) that improves DigiByte node's performance on testnet to facilitate the development. In March 2023 Decred stakeholders approved DGB integration as part of the latest [DEX development proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/ca6b749).
- Note that this stage is just software support in DCRDEX, getting DGB markets up and running is a [separate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1993#issuecomment-1456932743) task.

Server:

- Removed server startup requirement of having [DCR registration fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2293) configured, and removed code strictly tied to DCR fees. This old code was made obsolete by the ability to pay the registration fee in assets other than DCR. Now with the transition to fidelity bonds the multi-asset registration fee support is itself deprecated, but it will remain available for some time.
- Fixed handling of client requests that come [too quickly](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2229) after a swap error is returned to the client. { _may group_ }
- Fixed startup [balance check](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2312) bug that could erroneously unbook an order.

Internal and developer changes:

- Improved [domain parsing](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2277) utility to be useful in more cases. { _may group with refactoring_ }
- Refactored connection logic to remove a Go [anti-pattern](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2124) where both a non-empty result and non-empty error are returned and the caller needs to check both.
- Adjusted [Docker build](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2309) workflow to trigger more reliably when the release is published and to allow the manual triggering. { _may simplify and group_ }
- Introduced [`asset.Authenticator`](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2069) interface for wallets that require authentication (password entry). This gives various parts of the codebase a cleaner access to unlock and lock methods for wallet operations that require it.
- Removed duplicate code { 2226 }
- Fixed building of the Windows binary with [system tray](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2311) support.
- Test fixes { 2294 }

Other:

- Some of the [fixes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2323) listed above will be backported to the upcoming v0.6.1 release.
- Umbrel integration has been completed. Decred's Umbrel Community App Store has been [updated](https://github.com/decred/umbrel-app-store/pull/3) with the latest Docker image including DEX v0.6.0 release. Umbrel installation links have been [added](https://github.com/decred/dexweb/pull/34) to [dex.decred.org](https://dex.decred.org/). Finally, DEX v0.6 release on Umbrel has been [announced](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1648439889678192640) on Twitter.
- Litecoin node operators are [advised](https://twitter.com/chappjc/status/1645982431571329024) to upgrade their nodes to v0.21 and enable compact block filters. Currently it is hard for the built-in SPV wallet to find its first peer because not as many public full nodes serve compact filters. DCRDEX users can work-around this by manually adding peers from [this list](https://gist.github.com/chappjc/d0f26b12258f8531bb78b37f38d080a0).
- v0.6.0 comes with an experimental market maker bot that can be used to add liquidity to DEX markets. Use with great care.

In progress:

- [DCR staking](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2264) directly in the DEX wallet. This has triggered an effort to [extract more VSP code](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/382) from dcrwallet to the vspd repository to make it easier to reuse.
- Market maker bot. This is a big effort involving tasks like [command-line interface](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2304), [testing framework](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2303) simulating various market conditions, [trade performance monitoring](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2306), [segregating bot's balances](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2332), and more.
- [Arbitrage bot](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2005). Both bots are part of the recent [DEX bots proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/8b1ceda).
- Packaging DEX as a [desktop app](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1957). This will wrap the GUI in [WebView](https://github.com/webview/webview) so the DEX will behave like a normal desktop app with its own window, taskbar/tray icon, notifications, etc. without having to load it in a regular browser. This is part of the [packaging proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/ae7c4fe). Specialized packages for [Debian](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2308) and [macOS](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2333) are also in progress. Testers wanted! Join the [#dexdev](https://chat.decred.org/#/room/#dexdev:decred.org) chat and ask how to participate.
- [Polygon integration](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2319) (part of the [client dev proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/ca6b749)). Polygon is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum with faster execution and lower fees. Formerly known as Matic Network (MATIC token).
- New version of ETH [smart contract for swaps](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2038) which has potential to significantly [reduce fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1426).
- Fidelity bonds funded in [ETH](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2223).
- Initial research to integrate [Firo](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2270) has started. Firo is formerly known as Zcoin.

### dcrdata

_[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata) is an explorer for Decred blockchain and off-chain data like Politeia proposals, markets, and more._

- Validate [time grouping](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1960) parameter. { _looks like a minor fix, not worth a section for it_ }


### decred.org

_[dcrweb](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb) is the source code for the [decred.org](https://decred.org/) website._

- Updates for [v1.7.7 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1115).
- Added [Bison Relay](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1114) to [Community](https://decred.org/community/) links. { _sounds a bit like Ecosystem, but maybe keep here?_ }


### Bison Relay

_[Bison Relay](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay) is a new social media platform with strong protections against censorship, surveillance, and advertising, powered by Decred Lightning Network._

New features for v0.1.7 have been first tested by the community in Release Candidate 1 which revealed a few bugs that got fixed in v0.1.7 final. { _improve wording, we want to reflect the work put into making and testing RC builds_ }

Common changes in GUI and CLI apps in v0.1.7:

- Added progress tracking and automatic [retries to send DCR tips](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/176).

GUI app changes in v0.1.7:

- Added a menu command to [suggest](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/182) a user to do a key exchange with another user.
- Made received files interactive: each file has an icon indicating its type, and clicking the file opens it with a program as configured in the operating system.
- Added tooltip explaining the [Cost](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/196) field when sharing content.
- Added context menu when [right clicking](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/198) user name in various places like chat, user list, feed, or post comments. This provides faster access to tipping and other actions on users.
- Improved UX for [embedding files in posts](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/203). Several users missed to press the `+` button to add a file, resulting in posts without images. The confusing `+` button has been removed and files are now added in one action. Setting of alternative text has been moved to an optional modal.
- Added a page listing all [own posts](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/204).
- Added [prepaid invites](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/191). When such invite is imported its DCR will automatically fund the Bison Relay wallet of the invited user. This change also adds commands for managing the embedded DCR wallet such as create account, list accounts, and send DCR on-chain.
- Added [server-based invites](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/194) (aka RV-based invites) which avoid the need for exchanging invite files. Instead the invite is pushed to the server and its download is pre-paid by the sender. Receiving user may fetch such invite without paying to the server, and if the invite has any DCR in it, it can be redeemed to bootstrap invited user's wallet for using Bison Relay.
- Added automated [onboarding flow](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/197) using server-based invites. It performs all wallet setup tasks if given an appropriate prepaid invite key. Tasks include: fetch the invite, redeem funds, open outbound and inbound LN channels, and perform an initial key exchange.
- Fixed unwanted [newline](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/195) getting inserted when sending with the Enter key and the cursor is not at the end of the line. Also fixed sending of empty messages.
- Fixed error when getting [debug ratchet info](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/201). { _group_ }
- Fixed a few input forms not responding to [Enter key](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/198) (which should perform the default action).
- Fixed and improved chat [scroll behavior](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/207). New messages will no longer cause the scroll to the bottom and lose scroll position. After leaving and returning to a chat it will scroll to the bottom like in Element. Scroll to first unread message has been added.
- Fixed error message when using [Query Route](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/200) feature to check if there is a valid route to Bison Relay server's LN node.

GUI app issues found in v0.1.7 Release Candidate 1 and fixed in v0.1.7 final:

- Added [notifications](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/217) for new posts and new comments to existing posts. If there are unread items, icons on the main sidebar will change, Feed items will be tagged with "New Post" or "New Comments", and new comments will show in bold until the user clicks away from the post.
- Updated [icons](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/218) for macOS and Windows, changed app name from "bruig" to "bisonrelay".
- Fixed [New Post](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/210) button navigating to a wrong page. { _check 219 too_ }
- Fixed [icons](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/220) being hard to see in dark mode.
- Fixed Chats tab behaving like [like the user has no contacts yet](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/issues/211) and showing the initial invite view, until the app syncs with the network. This has been replaced with loading animation while the address book is loading.

CLI app changes in v0.1.7:

- Added an option to the `/channels` command to show [additional info](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/208) for LN channels.
- Fixed attempt to load TLS certificate when its path is empty on the "Request receive capacity" view.
- Updated the [build script](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/209) and removed leftovers from ZKC (Bison Relay's precedessor).

Server changes in v0.1.7:

- Accept additional RVs that are marked as [paid](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/193) but are not subscribed to by the client. This allows prepayment for RV subscriptions by other users. { _may be a minor prereq for prepaid invites, may group_ }

`clientrpc` [automation API](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/tree/master/clientrpc) changes in v0.1.7:

- Option to add a [group chat invite](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/205) to an invite file. { _may drop, group or mention in the common section as "new operations have been added to the clientrpc API"_ }

Changes merged in `master` towards future releases:

- (CLI) Fixed possible crash when listing [LN channel](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/222) balances with `/ln channels` command.
- (GUI) Updated [styles](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/225) for new post and new comment notifications.

Other stuff:

- Tipping bot Oprah will be [sending messages](https://matrix.to/#/!GHnoHXSgkVAsUknRUg:decred.org/$FKG9OTiG-WZO7vRl_-VhS9ST_EhvjpWOLeQjs9qvcyc?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com) to users when it fails to send a tip. This way, tip recipients will be notified of issues with their receive channels.
- Existing public group chats will be upgraded to support multiple admins and utilize the new onboarding admin bot. Members of such rooms should upgrade to v0.1.6 or higher.
- New [admin bot](https://matrix.to/#/!GHnoHXSgkVAsUknRUg:decred.org/$X75ujNeIVZdUSDf2HUwdlIzbXVzYsfKj-HnkWMJwpZk) will further streamline onboarding by helping new users discover public channels and inviting them automatically, removing the wait for a manual invite.
- After the onboarding work developers plan to work on [pages, stores and mobile apps](https://matrix.to/#/!GHnoHXSgkVAsUknRUg:decred.org/$oyK-Bcj3BRUfWvIcJcR4-gx-pOC7BbFRHm9KStEFmTk?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com).

### Other

- Decred's own [release](https://github.com/decred/release) build tool gained [build flavors](https://github.com/decred/release/pull/90) which will be used by DCRDEX builds with Windows system tray integration. Support for [OpenBSD on 64-bit ARM](https://github.com/decred/release/pull/88) has been added. [Windows on 64-bit ARM](https://github.com/decred/release/commit/542b45cf593c8c6dbfa1d2d92e67bf7c21e36f0e) was explored but removed due to one dependency not supporting it yet.
- [decred-release](https://github.com/decred/decred-release) automatic installer has been updated with hashes and signatures for v1.7.7 release.
- [dcrtest](https://github.com/decred/dcrtest/pull/11) integration test framework has been [updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrtest/pull/11) to latest Go modules from dcrd.
- During the reproducible building [sesssion](https://matrix.to/#/!zefvTnlxYHPKvJMThI:decred.org/$qjda4fjr5oQaDICsfnfhSRMmmoJtYx67zBrrRQqzyrk?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=planetdecred.org) for v1.7.7 developers encountered a mismatch in `go-ethereum` builds for DCRDEX, which turned out to be ["a doozy of a compiler bug"](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/59500). This has delayed the release by a few days, eventually the bug was fixed in Go 1.21.
