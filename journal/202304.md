## { Some Announcement }

{ _Add individual sections for high-impact announcements, such as consensus votes, software releases, milestones, major bugs, etc._ }


## Core Software v1.7.7 Release

}


## DCRDEX v0.6.0 Release

{ https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v0.6.0 }

Major highlights:

- ETH and ERC20 wallets and trading (currently no light wallet support)
- Built-in light wallets for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) allow to store and trade without running full nodes
- Registration fee is replaced with fidelity bonds - time-locked coins that can be returned back to the user
- Ability to connect to a DEX server in view-only mode
- Restyled Markets and Wallets pages with different layouts for various screen sizes
- Experimental market maker bot

Other notable changes { _maybe move to Dev_ }:

- Fee estimates on Send pages
- Ability to disable an existing wallet
- UI to archive older order data
- Snappier order placement
- Recent matches shown on the Markets page
- Numerous improvements and fixes in Electrum support, Ethereum support, order tracking and presentation, error reporting, fee estimation, translations, and much more

Tip: Built-in LTC wallet can be slow to get started as it searches for a node that supports compact block filters. Users can go to wallet settings, click Manage Peers, and add one manually to help boostrap the process { what's this? https://gist.github.com/chappjc/d0f26b12258f8531bb78b37f38d080a0 }

### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Changes backported to [v1.7.7 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/releases/tag/release-v1.7.7):

- Increased minimum Go version to 1.17 for [`peer`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/0d375e0738e5995b1c3beb303a654aefe76e4a64) and [`addrmgr](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/235233906177b5c429f0e1297cc05bafb9d60b15) modules to enable Go toolchain optimizations like [module graph pruning](https://go.dev/ref/mod#graph-pruning) and [lazy module loading](https://go.dev/ref/mod#lazy-loading).
- Increased version of the peer-to-peer [protocol](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/ad501373e203aeff56e8f7f699ab442f8706694e) used by the `peer` module to no longer use the `reject` message (we explained it in [November](202211.md#dcrd)).
- Fixed caching of other peers' [known inventory](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3074) (small traffic optimization).
- Optimized [peer address selection](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commit/32e98be286deb3104352f81fe8c1147c1f158e29) and mitigated excessive CPU usage in testnet scenarios.
- Updated code formatting, build scripts and README for [Go 1.20](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3087).
- Updated to latest `sys` module (low-level interaction with the operating system) to support building on OpenBSD with 64-bit [RISC-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V) processors.
- All backported changes have been added to the [release branch](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commits/release-v1.7) as opposed to just increasing module version numbers in the `go.mod` file. This makes building from the release branch more [straightforward](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3083).
- Background: the [`peer`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/8f3e249555544ff8f1991d055da1e910dbd5a88b/peer) and [`addrmgr`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/8f3e249555544ff8f1991d055da1e910dbd5a88b/addrmgr) modules provide a solid foundation for building software that talks to the Decred network. { _optional edu bit, may drop_ }

Changes merged in `master` towards future releases:

- Added definitions for the upcoming consensus votes to change the [proof-of-work hashing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3089) to [BLAKE3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)#BLAKE3) and to change [reduce PoW block rewards](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3090). These changes will be documented more formally in [Decred Change Proposals](https://github.com/decred/dcps) DCP-0011 and DCP-0012, respectively. The definitions only add basic information like vote description, choices, and validity dates. Code implementing the real changes will be added separately.
- Implemented the [DCP-0012 consensus vote](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3092). If it passes, block reward split will change to: 1% PoW, 89% PoS, 10% Treasury {}
- Added a function for [generating a private key](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3096) using a custom source of entropy. Having such function in dcrd allows to remove duplication from other Decred packages. { _improved in 3097 and 3100_ }
- Test and logging code refactoring { 3104 3105 3107 3108 - _drop after review_ }
- Cleanup { 3106 - _drop after review_ }
- Versions of several modules have been bumped to enable Go's module graph pruning across the codebase.

- Project Lead Jake Yocom-Piatt reports [peer-to-peer mixing](https://twitter.com/exitusdcr/status/1655095852392935425) will eventually replace the central server that coordinates mixes.


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

Client changes merged in v0.6.0 release:

- Do not put API server's address to Content Security Policy (CSP) HTTP header if it is an [IPv6 address](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2287). This is a fix for a workaround for a [Safari bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201591) that resulted some icons [not loading](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1652) properly.
- Fixed logging. { _d163705, group_ }
- Fixed potential integer [overflow](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2285) when calculating Ethereum transaction confirmations.
- Fixed [wrong color](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2279) of price change percentage label. { _may group_ }

All other changes below are merged in `master` towards future releases.

Client: { _maybe further split into user-facing and internal_ }

- Log an error when failing to [re-parse HTML template](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2291). This feature is used by developers for quick iterations on pages. { _group_ }
- Show a notification when [failing to connect](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2288) to a wallet.
- Default to using [`127.0.0.1`](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2283) IPv4 address when it is not specified in the config. This helps to satisfy the [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) protocol in a way that also work-arounds a bug in Safari. The new default avoids an issue where some [icons](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1652) are not loading properly because of CSP failures. { _follow-up fix in 2295; simplify and/or group_ }
- Added [release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2276) for v0.6.0.
- Always show market's [recent matches](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2307). Previously the Recent Matches list was cleared in some situations like restarting the client.
- Show [order rate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2281) in the collapsed order view. Rate (price) is an important info that must be visible without having to click to expand order details.
- Removed excess [trailing zeroes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2278) from some UI elements and improved overall consistency of number formatting.
- Remember last selected [candle size](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2284) across page reloads. Default candle size changed from 5 min to 1 hour.
- Track confirmations for the [redeem transaction](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2049) and retry it if necessary. This is addressing an edge case when the mempool is so full that transactions paying lower fees are purged and never mined. Such transactions must be retried later, possibly with a higher fee.
- Improved logging { 2314 2318 }
- Fixed market [prices](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2280) on the left sidebar going out of sync. { _may group_ }
- Fixed handling of server [notifications](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2286) that may come before client's markets are initialized.
- Fixed some [asset icons](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2310) getting removed on the Markets page. { _group_ }
- Fixed buy/sell [bar indicator](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2313) color and the missing "active" indicator (green dot) on orders that are in progress. { _group with UI fixes or something_ }
- Fixed error during [shutdown](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2325) when running in Decrediton.

Ethereum:

- Show more meaningful [Walle Type](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2207) like "RPC" for ETH wallets powered by 3rd party data providers and "Ethereum token" for USDC wallets.
- Updated [docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2289): Removed ArchiveNode.io provider which is shutting down, advised against using Flashbots.net, added Wallet Recovery tips.
- Refactored code for [rotating bonds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2275) to integrate ETH bonds more easily.
- Changed to broadcast transactions to [all RPC providers](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2266) instead of only one preferred provider. This should help ensure the transactions quickly propagate and are mined.
- Added [config guide link](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2261) to forms related to wallet setup. Also two fields will be shown for RPC providers instead of one. It is important that users understand that provider's failure may lead to loss of funds, and confugire 2 or more providers to always have a fallback.
- Added a developer tool for getting [gas estimates](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2050) for DEX-critical operations on Ethereum. It will help to add new tokens or new contract versions.

Litecoin:

- Ported [transaction size fixes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2299) from [ltcd](https://github.com/ltcsuite/ltcd/pull/25) to handle some unusually large SegWit transactions.
- Some MimbleWimble [decoder code](https://github.com/ltcsuite/ltcd/issues/17#issuecomment-1201877368) written for DCRDEX has been [adopted](https://github.com/ltcsuite/ltcd/issues/17#issuecomment-1506234416) in [ltcd](https://github.com/ltcsuite/ltcd/pull/31).

Zcash:

- Replaced usages of [deprecated address methods](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2237) for Zcash. This requires zcashd v5.4.2 or newer.
- Added [initial](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2317) [infrastructure](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2250) for shielded pools, a Zcash feature enabling private balances and transactions. First stage of Zcash privacy integration will be limited to shielding/unshielding own funds, and sending from own shielded to arbitrary shielded or transparent addresses. Only transparent addresses will be involved in swap activity.
- Fixed spelling of [Zcash](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2300) across the codebase.
- Fixed ZEC wallet [creation form](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2329). { _group_ }

DigiByte:

- DigiByte swaps have been tested on [mainnet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1993#issuecomment-1487571640), DGB support has been [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1993) and may be [released](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1993#issuecomment-1511304826) in the upcoming v0.6.1.
- Running a DigiByte full node is currently the only option since it is based on Bitcoin Core v0.17 and has no [compact filters](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/1992#issue-1486990539) support (so DEX cannot implement a built-in DGB wallet). A big upgrade to Bitcoin Core v22 features is [in progress](https://github.com/DigiByte-Core/digibyte/pull/63) so this may change in the future.
- For some background, DGB community members expressed interest back in November 2022 and have been [active](https://twitter.com/JohnnyLaw2021/status/1587801707790180353) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dgb_ycagel/status/1599944772403466241) and DEX's [GitHub](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1993#issuecomment-1459097459). @chappjc created a [patch](https://github.com/DigiByte-Core/digibyte/pull/102) that improves DigiByte node's performance testnet to facilitate. In March 2023 Decred stakeholders approved DGB integration as part of the latest [DEX development proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/ca6b749).
- Note that this stage is just software support in DCRDEX, getting DGB markets up and running is a [separate](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1993#issuecomment-1456932743) task.

Server:

- Removed server startup requirement of having [DCR registration fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2293) configured, and removed code strictly tied to DCR fees. This old code was made obsolete by the ability to pay the registration fee in any asset supporting it. Now with the transition to fidelity bonds the multi-asset registration fee support is itself deprecated, but it will remain available for some time.
- Fixed handling of client requests that come [too quickly](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2229) after a swap error is returned to the client. { _may group_ }
- Fixed startup [balance check](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2312) bug that could erroneously unbook an order.

Internal and developer changes:

- Improved [domain parsing](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2277) utility to apply in more use cases. { _may group with refactoring_ }
- Refactored connection logic to remove a Go [anti-pattern](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2124) where both a non-empty result and non-empty error are returned and the caller needs to check both.
- Adjusted [Docker build](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2309) workflow to trigger more reliably when the release is published and to allow the manual triggering. { _may simplify and group_ }
- Introduced [`asset.Authenticator`](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2069) interface for wallets that require authentication (password entry). This gives various parts of the codebase a cleaner access to unlock and lock methods for wallet operations that require it.
- Removed duplicate code { 2226 }
- Fixed building of the Windows binary with [system tray](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2311) support.
- Test fixes { 2294 }

Other:

- Some of the [fixes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2323) listed above will be backported to the upcoming v0.6.1 release.
- Umbrel integration: Decred's Umbrel Community App Store has been [updated](https://github.com/decred/umbrel-app-store/pull/3) with the latest Docker image including DEX v0.6.0 release. Umbrel installation links have been [added](https://github.com/decred/dexweb/pull/34) to [dex.decred.org](https://dex.decred.org/). Finally, DEX v0.6 release on Umbrel has been [announced](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1648439889678192640) on Twitter.
- { Litecoin users are advised to upgrade their nodes to v0.21 https://twitter.com/chappjc/status/1645982431571329024 . Currently it is hard for the built-in SPV wallet to find its first peer because not as many public full nodes serve compact filters. }
- { v0.6.0 comes with an experimental market maker bot that can be used to add liquidity to DEX markets. Use with care https://matrix.to/#/!teQafvHMYpIbqLIieU:decred.org/$kwxP2tbfEC-kcId2mpl4RIa1A-gMEaVqnFNwG44fmck }

In progress:

- [DCR staking](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2264) directly in the DEX wallet. This has triggered an effort to [extract more VSP code](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/382) from dcrwallet to the vspd repository to make it easier to reuse.
- Market maker bot. This is a big effort involving tasks like [command-line interface](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2304), [testing framework](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2303) simulating various market conditions, [trade performance monitoring](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2306), [segregating bot's balances](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2332)
- [Arbitrage bot](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2005) (part of the [DEX bots proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/8b1ceda)).
- Packaging DEX as a [desktop app](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1957). This will wrap the GUI in a [WebView](https://github.com/webview/webview) browser so the DEX will behave like a normal desktop app with its own window, taskbar/tray icon, notifications, etc. without having to load it in a regular browser. This is part of the [packaging proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/ae7c4fe). Specialized packages for [Debian](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2308) and [macOS](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2333) are also in progress. Testers wanted! Join the [#dexdev](https://chat.decred.org/#/room/#dexdev:decred.org) chat and ask how to participate.
- [Polygon integration](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2319) (part of the [client dev proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/ca6b749)). Polygon is a new name for Matic Network.
- New version of ETH [smart contract for swaps](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2038) which has potential to significantly [reduce fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1426).
- Fidelity bonds funded in [ETH](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2223).
- Initial research to integrate [Firo](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2270) (formerly known as Zcoin) has started.

New features of v0.1.7 have been first tested by the community in Release Candidate 1 which revealed a few bugs that got fixed in v0.1.7 final. { _improve wording, we want to reflect the work put into making and testing RC builds_ }

{ v0.1.7-rc1:

- https://matrix.to/#/!GHnoHXSgkVAsUknRUg:decred.org/$v6ve40-VoqK7MpdihLzcp-Sy_3T43JLkOsc6kE3sumo
- Prepaid invites
- New dmg for macOS
- Signed builds
- Right click menu
- macos bruig bins should be nicely signed and notarized this time around as well
- highlighting of unread post comments

}

Common changes in GUI and CLI apps in v0.1.7:

- Added progress tracking and automatic [retries to send DCR tips](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/176).

GUI app changes in v0.1.7:

- Added a menu command to [suggest](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/182) a user to do a key exchange with another user.
- Made received files interactive: each file has an icon indicating its type, and clicking the file opens it with a program as configured in the operating system.
- Added tooltip explaining the [Cost](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/196) field when sharing content.
- Added context menu when [right clicking](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/198) user name in various places like chat, user list, feed, or post comments. This provides faster access to tipping and other actions on users.
- Improved UX for [embedding files in posts](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/203). Several users missed to press the `+` button to add a file, resulting in posts without images. The confusing `+` button has been removed and files are now added in one action. Setting of alternative text has been moved to an optional modal.
- Added a page listing all [own posts](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/204).
- Added [prepaid invites](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/191). When such invite is imported its DCR will automatically fund the Bison Relay wallet of the invited user. This change also adds commands for managing the embedded DCR wallet such as create account, list accounts, and send DCR on-chain.
- Added [server-based invites](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/194) (aka RV-based invites) which avoid the need for exchanging invite files. Instead the invite is pushed to the server and its download is pre-paid by the sender. Receiving user may fetch such invite without paying to the server, and if the invite has any DCR in it, it can be redeemed to bootstrap invited user's wallet for using Bison Relay.
- Added automated [onboarding flow](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/197) using server-based invites. It performs all wallet setup tasks if given an appropriate prepaid invite key. Tasks include: fetch the invite, redeem funds, open outbound and inbound LN channels, and perform an initial key exchange.
- Fixed unwanted [newline](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/195) getting inserted when sending with the Enter key and the cursor is not at the end of the line. Also fixed sending of empty messages.
- Fixed error when getting [debug ratchet info](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/201). { _group_ }
- Fixed a few input forms not responding to [Enter key](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/198) (which should perform the default action).
- Fixed and improved chat [scroll behavior](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/207). New messages will no longer cause the scroll to the bottom and lose scroll position. After leaving and returning to a chat it will scroll to the bottom like in Element. Scroll to first unread message has been added.
- Fixed error message when using [Query Route](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/200) feature to check if there is a valid route to Bison Relay server's LN node.

GUI app issues found in v0.1.7 Release Candidate 1 and fixed in v0.1.7 final:

- Added [notifications](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/217) for new posts and new comments to existing posts. If there are unread items, icons on the main sidebar will change, Feed items will be tagged with "New Post" or "New Comments", and new comments will show in bold until the user clicks away from the post.
- Updated [icons](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/218) for macOS and Windows, changed app name from "bruig" to "bisonrelay".
- Fixed [New Post](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/210) button navigating to a wrong page. { _check 219 too_ }
- Fixed [icons](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/220) being hard to see in dark mode.
- Fixed Chats tab behaving like [like the user has no contacts yet](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/issues/211) and showing the initial invite view, until the app syncs with the network. This has been replaced with loading animation while the address book is loading.

CLI app changes in v0.1.7:

- Added an option to the `/channels` command to show [additional info](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/208) for LN channels.
- Fixed attempt to load TLS certificate when its path is empty on the "Request receive capacity" view.
- Updated the [build script](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/209) and removed leftovers from ZKC (Bison Relay's precedessor).

Server changes in v0.1.7:

- Accept additional RVs that are marked as [paid](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/193) but are not subscribed to by the client. This allows prepayment for RV subscriptions by other users. { _may be a minor prereq for prepaid invites, may group_ }

`clientrpc` [automation API](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/tree/master/clientrpc) changes in v0.1.7:

- Option to add a [group chat invite](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/205) to an invite file. { _may drop, group or mention in the common section as "new operations have been added to the clientrpc API"_ }

Changes merged in `master` towards future releases:

- (CLI) Fixed possible crash when listing [LN channel](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/222) balances with `/ln channels` command.
- (GUI) Updated [styles](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/225) for new post and new comment notifications.

Other stuff:

- Tipping bot Oprah will be [sending messages](https://matrix.to/#/!GHnoHXSgkVAsUknRUg:decred.org/$FKG9OTiG-WZO7vRl_-VhS9ST_EhvjpWOLeQjs9qvcyc?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com) to users when it fails to send a tip. This way, tip recipients will be notified of issues with their receive channels.
- { Upgrade notice https://matrix.to/#/!GHnoHXSgkVAsUknRUg:decred.org/$YGNKX-qlCki5JmQTJBNV5Iaqqgaa8HXUwPCjK2s89gQ?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com }

Future plans:

- { paid invites, gc version bump, pivot to mobile/pages/stores https://matrix.to/#/!GHnoHXSgkVAsUknRUg:decred.org/$tHVPhrrHxzvFp6uG27ACJM8lKML6VaR5JHO8wsdKDec }

## Ecosystem

{ _Hint: "Ecosystem" is about new units of infrastructure or updates from existing: VSPs, exchanges, wallets, OTC desks, payment processors, investors. It is more about user-facing services, businesses, and wider adoption, while Network is more about the backbone. Use bullets or paragraphs, whatever looks best._
