## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover notable dev work as recommended below._
  - _Step 1: Add every PR/commit in chronological order (oldest first)_
    - _this is for easier intermediate review_
  - _Step 2: Order/group changes "most released first":_
    - _changes released to end users_
    - _merged to master_
    - _in progress (work started)_
    - _discussions and future plans_
  - _Step 3: Organize further:_
    - _user-facing up top_
    - _dev stuff down below_
  - _Step 4: After dev review, group further and tidy_
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

In progress:

- { maybe https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3911 }
- The [change](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/pull/2703) in trezor-firmware repository required for [staking DCR with Trezor](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2681) has been synced with latest code but remains unmerged. It is waiting since December 2022 and it is unclear when it could get merged. Help to push it forward is appreciated.

}

The Monero Community Crowdfunding System (CCS) wallet was [drained](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/916) of the entire balance of 2,675 XMR (~ $450,000 USD) by an unknown attacker. The XMR in the wallet had been donated by community members to fund approved projects being completed by other community members, it was administered by developers luigi and fluffypony and it is not known how the attacker was able to access the funds. Funds were stolen on Sep 1 but it was not discovered until late September.

THORswap, a decentralized exchange on the THORchain platform, put its front end into [maintenance](https://x.com/THORSwap/status/1710162462639575065) mode as a response to funds from the $475M FTX hack being exchanged from ETH to BTC on the platform. Around $120M was exchanged before THORswap went into maintenance mode, but the hacker still managed to [bridge](https://www.theblock.co/post/256127/elliptic-finds-apparent-russian-connection-in-laundering-of-ftx-stolen-funds) funds to THORchain using other venues. Around one week later THORswap [resumed](https://www.theblock.co/post/256301/thorswap-resumes-with-updated-terms-to-exclude-users-from-sanctioned-countries) front end services with a change to the terms of use forbidding users from countries sanctioned by the US, UK or European Union - and an unnamed chain surveillance partner to assist with identifying addresses associated with these jurisdictions. 

Reddit [announced](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/reddit-is-phasing-out-community-points-blockchain-rewards) the end of its experiment with Community Points (MOON and BRICK tokens for the /r/cryptocurrency and /r/fortnite subreddits), and the prices for the tokens promptly plunged. The reason given for the decision is difficulty and resource costs associated with scaling the system to the rest of the platform's communities. The 3 year experiment started with tokens tradeable on Ethereum, then to reduce costs it was moved to Arbitrum Nova, an Ethereum Layer 2 - but reddit has decided to abandon the decentralized ledger aspect of any future Community Points alternative. 

it was [noted](https://twitter.com/Pledditor/status/1714610041699930439) that 3 of the moderators of /r/cryptocurrency who had early warning of the news used this opportunity to dump their MOONs, causing a 22% drop in price just before the news came out and the price declined 90%. These moderators were [removed](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/23/reddit-crypto-community-removes-moderators-accused-of-moon-insider-trading/) by the rest of the mod team, who stated an intent to keep the MOONs token going in some form on the subreddit.

The Wall Street Journal published a series of [articles](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/militants-behind-israel-attack-raised-millions-in-crypto-b9134b7a) about Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad which stated that the organisations were successfully raising millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency, which was apparently based on a mis-reading of the on chain data. [Chainalysis](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/10/19/hamas-crypto-funding-likely-overstated-chainalysis/) and Elliptic have indicated that their reading of the data is very different, with many of the entities caught up in the higher amounts being intermediaries with no direct links to terror funding. Nic Carter has been leading the criticism of the articles,  including with a [bounty](https://x.com/nic__carter/status/1717622001014067417) program for open source analyses funded with $10,500 initially then increased with further contributions by other funders and supplemented with other bounty [programs](https://x.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1719363225827922004). The WSJ have since [rolled back](https://x.com/nic__carter/status/1717997939140722758) some of the claims in the original article, but it is not clear if that has diminished the enthusiasm of the 104 Congressional representatives who [signed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/11/08/how-misinformation-on-hamas-and-crypto-fooled-nearly-20-of-congress/) a letter calling for enquiries into crypto fundraising by Hamas on the strength of the original article.


{ _Hints (all optional):_

_1. Besides dramatic "epic fails", try to also report "epic wins" in areas relevant to Decred. Balance is good and we can learn from both._

_2. Order the stories as follows:_

- _Crypto L1 tech: PoW, ASIC resistance, full nodes, network security, etc._
- _Crypto L2+ tech: "Smart" contracts, DEX projects_
- _Crypto governance, finances, transparency, funding, chain forks, community splits_
- _Relevant exchanges and websites_
- _Regulations, privacy, security_
- _Fun stuff_
