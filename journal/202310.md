## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

User-facing changes:

- Added support for [concurrent `getdata` requests](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3203). Currently a node can process only one `getdata` request at a time, a behavior inherited from very early network code that is no longer relevant. While the data for one `getdata` request is being served, other messages that would otherwise be fast to process, such as pings, can potentionally be delayed for a long time. Moreover, it is theoretically possible for a pair of peers to get stuck waiting for each other. In practice this situation basically never happens but this may change in the future when new messages are introduced such as those for peer-to-peer mixing. To improve overall throughput and address the aforementioned concerns, `getdata` requests have been made asynchronous so other inbound messages can be processed concurrently. New limits have been introduced as well in order to block malicious behavior. This change to the wire protocol is planned for inclusion in the v1.9.0 release.
- Concurrent `getdata` requests also happen to reduce the [initial chain sync](https://matrix.to/#/!zefvTnlxYHPKvJMThI:decred.org/$mxemr1HGLNlX4eXYPuG9rTVUb15Jg7lWudGK3TQJEG0) time from ~81 to ~47 minutes (as measured on a developer's benchmark system). Prior to this change, blocks would be served in batches and each request for the next batch would have to wait until the previous batch is received. Due to the network latency involved the "idle" time between batches of blocks could add up to ~5 seconds. Given there are 800K+ blocks and they are typically served in batches of 2,000, a full initial sync would incur 400+ such delays, or ~33 minutes.
- Updated `dcrutil` package to obtain [user's home directory](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3196) from the `$HOME` environment variable instead of parsing `/etc/passwd`. This is to make it compatible with packaging systems like Flatpak or Snap. These systems provide sandboxed environments for applications and don't allow binaries to directly write to the home directory. Instead, they designate a separate directory per app and set `$HOME` accordingly. This change is needed for the [packaging effort](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2581) underway for the DCRDEX desktop app.

Developer and internal changes:

- Updated the [Docker image](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3198) to build with Go 1.21.3.
- Consolidated shutdown code to reduce the amount of [long-running goroutines](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3199) and make the use of [`WaitGroup`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3200)'s more local, which is easier to reason about and less error prone.
- Improved handling of [peer data](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3201) in the sync manager to simplify the code and eliminate some hard to hit corner cases.
- { _omitting: 3195 (relnotes), 3197 (docker), 3202 (logging), 3204 (3203 fix)_ }

[dcrdtest](https://github.com/decred/dcrtest/tree/master/dcrdtest) integration testing harness:

- Simplified API to make the package [more broadly useful](https://github.com/decred/dcrtest/pull/17), not just in tests, but also in benchmarks and in generic code not tied specifically to tests.
- Ensure [cleanup code](https://github.com/decred/dcrtest/pull/18) always runs even if test setup failed. This also adds a flag to keep the data files intact to ease debugging test failures.

_Image: Initial chain sync is ~40% faster with concurrent getdata requests_


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

- Updated [bbolt](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2290) database to v1.3.8 to avoid using `syscall(2)` on OpenBSD because this API will be removed. The [patch to bbolt](https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt/pull/404) has been contributed by Decred developers.
- Optimized [initial chain sync](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2292) time and memory use.


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

Merged in `master`:

- Fixed [Trezor build](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3922) failure caused by a change in the trezor-connect library.

In progress:

- Decred developers have updated the [patch](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/pull/2703) for trezor-firmware required for [staking DCR with Trezor](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2681) but it remains unmerged. It is waiting since December 2022 and it is unclear when it could get merged. Help to push it forward is appreciated. It is technically possible to get Trezor staking working with Decrediton today by flashing the Trezor with custom firmware, but the device will show a scary red "UNSAFE, DO NOT USE!" warning so this method is not suitable for most users.


### dcrseeder

_[dcrseeder](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder) is a crawler that maintains a list of reliable Decred nodes and helps new nodes to discover their first peers._

- Updated to build and test with [Go 1.21](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder/pull/59), simplified the build script, and added more linters (linters automatically check the code for issues).
- Improved [handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder/pull/61) of [shutdown signals](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder/pull/60) sent by the operating systems, and added logging so it is clear why the process is shutting down.
- Preparations for [dual network](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder/pull/62) support: reduced the use of global state, simplified initialization logic, and changed shutdown tasks to run via `defer` which is more error proof.
- Added support for a single instance of dcrseeder to crawl [mainnet and testnet](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder/pull/63) simultaneously. It will run two HTTP servers on two different ports.


### gominer

_[gominer](https://github.com/decred/gominer) is a proof of work Decred BLAKE3 miner for solo and pool mining with OpenCL and CUDA devices._

gominer was updated to support pool mining via the Stratum protocol. All changes below are included in the [v2.0.0 release](https://github.com/decred/gominer/releases/tag/release-v2.0.0). It is a source-only release with no binaries but the build process is [well-documented](https://github.com/decred/gominer#readme).

- Reworked handling of [nonces](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/219) to allow Stratum support. Mining devices need to find a hash of the block header that would satisfy the difficulty requirement. [Decred block header](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0011/dcp-0011.mediawiki#user-content-Proof_of_Work_Hash) is a 180-byte structure where most bytes store useful data and cannot change. To give miners a way to change the hash, the header contains a few special bytes called nonces. Miners continuously "roll" the nonces and recalculate the hash until a good hash is found. Stratum is a popular protocol to distribute this mining work to multiple devices, and it requires nonces to be used in a different way from solo mining.
- Corrected multiple issues with [Stratum and pooled mining](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/220), mainly related to populating and using the data structures as required by the Stratum protocol.
- Use [rpcclient](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/208) [package](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/645f649907cda2e5510241959d16e61a936d212b/rpcclient) in solo mining code. This change removes duplicate code and switches to getting data from dcrd more efficiently through WebSocket notifications instead of polling.
- Added initial call to [getwork](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/224) in solo mining mode to start mining immediately without waiting until a new block or transaction shows up.
- Reworked how [program version](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/221) is handled to be more reliable and match other Decred software. The output of `gominer --version` will now include the Git revision from which gominer was built.
- Updated [README](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/225) with instructions for running gominer with dcrpool and other Stratum-based pools.
- { _omitting: 223_ }


### dcrpool

_[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool) is server software for running a Decred mining pool._

October's changes focused on adding BLAKE3 and gominer support:

- Optimized how [data is sent to miners](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/409). Some of the old ASICs incorrectly used the second "generation transaction" field. Decred's block header is better designed for mining compared to Bitcoin's and that field should not have been used for Decred. Given that the old ASICs no longer work with the network, this takes the opportunity to stop using the "gentx2" field by putting all the relevant information into "gentx1", which is correct and more efficient.
- Modified the pool to work with [BLAKE3](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/412) as now required by the Decred network.
- Added [gominer v2.0.x](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/413) as a supported mining client.
- Fixed a [data race](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/402).
- Fixed a bug where the pool was not correctly tracking the [blocks](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/416) it mined. As a result, it was never sending the coinbase from such blocks to the mining participants.

Internal and developer changes:

- Limit the maximum [block generation time](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/411) to the target block time for each network. This is needed for proper simnet support.
- Use regular expressions to [identify clients](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/406). This allows to support new versions of mining clients without requiring updates to the pool software.
- Reworked [client identification](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/415) logic to more easily support different miner versions.
- Multiple smaller internal changes: removed unused code, improved logging, improved test code, etc.
  - { _404 (fix tests), 405 (logging), 403 (dynamic share weights, future proofing), 407 (refactor), 410 (fmt), 408 (unused), 414 (readme), 417 (harness), 418 (simplify, unexport), 419 (simplify)_ }


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

Changes backported to the next v0.6.x release and next Decrediton release:

- Added a [workaround](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2596) for DCRDEX window not loading in Decrediton. Electron version used in Decrediton had to be upgraded to unlock Ledger support, but newer Electron version broke DCRDEX integration. A long and painful bug hunt revealed that Electron v21.3.0 introduced an odd non-existent locale "c", and the workaround is to explicitly not use it for formatting numbers in DCRDEX.

Work listed below has been merged to `master` towards future releases.

Client:

- Added ability to [reset a forgotten app password](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2477) using app seed.
- Added [browser and desktop notifications](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2558) for events like order changes, bonds, or server connectivity issues. These notifications are shown even when the DEX window is not active.
- Updated [user documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2538) to reflect the new DEX client account creation flow.
- Fixed handling of [unsupported assets](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2548) on the Markets view.
- Fixed a bug during [adding of a new DEX server](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2566).
- { _omitting: 2572, 2544, 2564, 2551, 2585_ }

Account reputation, bonds, trading limits:

- Reworked calculations of [account tier](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2501). The concept of "bonus tiers" has been removed, it wasn't doing anything useful but added complexity. Server will now send updates for score changes that the client was previously unaware. These and other internal changes will help the client to track its account score and tier more reliably and not miss bond renewals (which may result in account losing the ability to trade until the target tier is restored).
- Reworked [trading limits](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2503) to fix unreasonably [low trading limits](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2472) on some markets with low transaction fees. *Lot size* is the minimum amount of coins that can be traded, it protects successful trades from paying too high on-chain fees (relative to the amount traded). On the other hand, *trading limit* is the maximum amount the user can put in an order book, it protects from losing too much on fees in case the trade fails and gets refunded. Low-fee trading pairs (such as DCR/LTC) have smaller lots and allow smaller minimum trades, which is great for user experience. The problem with low-fee markets was that their trading limits were unreasonably low due to the formula used. That formula has been improved to allow more value to be traded at a time on such markets.
- Exposed more [bond information](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2485) on Settings UI such as current and target account tiers and amount locked in bonds.

Decred:

- Added a workaround for a dcrwallet bug where a transaction may [never be marked as confirmed](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2555) if the wallet is shut down at the wrong time.
- Implemented live UI updates for [staking statistics](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2497) and ticket price.
- Update [balances](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2554) of Decred SPV wallet when new unmined transactions are detected in the mempool.

Bitcoin:

- Added support for public [chain data providers](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2547) (aka RPC providers).

Ethereum:

- Added local storage of ETH wallet's [transaction history](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2504). This is needed because Ethereum data providers do not support querying the transactions an account has made. Additionally, having wallet's transactions available locally allows to consolidate and optimize the code tracking unconfirmed transactions and reduce reliance on RPC providers.

Zclassic:

- Initial [Zclassic support](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2523) in the backend and the UI (no shielded wallets for now).

Developer and internal changes:

- Automated the tedious process of updating [cache busters](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2557).
- Updated [loadbot](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2420) to start with market rate based on coins' real market price. If this mode is enabled, the "whale" test program will try to push the test market to the real prices rather than random values. This is part of the [market maker testing framework](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2303) that will be used to evaluate how bots perform under different market conditions.
- Store completed [candles](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2443) in the database. Computing candles for the charts is an expensive operation and caching its results in the database fixes [slow server startup](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2151).
- { _omitting: 2571_ }

Other news:

- Circle has launched a [native Polygon USDC token](https://www.circle.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-native-usdc-on-polygon-pos) as a more efficient alternative to the USDC "bridged" from Ethereum to Polygon (known as USDC.e). DEX developers consider [switching](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues/2559) to this new token while Polygon is not in any stable DEX release to minimize disruption for end users.
- Wrapped Ethereum and Wrapped Bitcoin [may land](https://matrix.to/#/!SFRQQFIHUUNXARfvew:decred.org/$OjqKljf7nmCrKB7YV4aYkh7Evf_zMzmpXqTFDGrzexQ) in the next minor release.

### Bison Relay

_[Bison Relay](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay) is a new social media platform with strong protections against censorship, surveillance, and advertising, powered by Decred Lightning Network._

GUI app changes merged in `master`:

- Fixed scroll position [jumping](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/pull/358) to the beginning of the day when new chat messages are posted.

Android:

- First [test messages](https://matrix.to/#/!GHnoHXSgkVAsUknRUg:decred.org/$Jqn9kojtkwKeCn83jIRsw1JT-hsocBdX4WCrFfmjuWY) have been sent from Android. Syncing took about 10 minutes and used 10-15% of the battery. A fresh BR install on Android was [reported](https://matrix.to/#/!GHnoHXSgkVAsUknRUg:decred.org/$6Nm8gEMHy1UgaNL-HjM1CCXH69yhNY9O7EJ5rEAVgzc) to take around 1 gigabyte.


### Cake Wallet Integration

[Cake Wallet](https://cakewallet.com/) is an open source, self-custodial multi-asset wallet for XMR, BTC, LTC, and other coins, running on Android, iOS, macOS and Linux.

Here's the Decred integration story so far:

- @Tivra connected Decred with Cake Wallet, which resulted in a collaborative [video livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KKsD4ZhZn0) with [Vik Sharma](https://twitter.com/vikrantnyc) and [Justin Ehrenhofer](https://twitter.com/JEhrenhofer) in August 2023.
- Chat room has been created to discuss the integration and experiment with code. Cake Wallet is built from a complex mix of Dart+Flutter (main app language), C++ (Monero), Go (Ethereum), and Kotlin and Swift (for native integration bits for Android and iOS). The process of setting up a working build environment is best characterized as "build hell" since it is not fully documented and getting it to build for just one platform is quite a challenge, while there are four targets in total (Linux, macOS, Android, iOS).
- A few Decred screens were added as a proof of concept and a working Android build was achieved.
- A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/2f25f2d) to fund the Decred integration was submitted. It didn't reach quorum due to Decred hardfork issues and was resubmitted in September. [Second proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/b3bdacb) was approved in October.
- Developers evaluated integration strategies and settled on creating a Decred library based on the code from DCRDEX and Cryptopower's [libwallet](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower/tree/master/libwallet), and compiling it as a C library that could be called from Dart code. The second option was to build the library with gomobile, write platform-specific glue code (Kotlin and Swift), and use Dart's "platform channels" to call the native code. This approach was discarded as more difficult.
- Cake Wallet's code repository was forked into a [staging repository](https://github.com/JoeGruffins/cake_wallet) to have a place for quick iteration until something is ready to be submitted upstream.
- Initial [libwallet](https://github.com/itswisdomagain/libwallet/pull/1) version was submitted for code review, it is a simple library for building SPV wallet apps for DCR, BTC and LTC. The plan is to use this library from Cake Wallet, Cryptopower and possibly other software.
- Initial [Decred screens](https://github.com/JoeGruffins/cake_wallet/pull/1) were merged in the staging fork to create a shared baseline to start developing.


### Other

[VSP list API](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/blob/master/docs/api.md) now exposes [Missed and Expired](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/pull/180) ticket counts separately, which allows to more accurately evaluate VSP's reliability. Low missed count is better, while expired tickets are normal and don't indicate a problem with a VSP.

@Exitus organized a Decred developer "Ask Me Anyting" (AMA) [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/1700xyi/decred_developer_ask_me_anything_ama_feat_dev/) which collected 77 comments, some highlights:

- Next big things in [core network development](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/1700xyi/decred_developer_ask_me_anything_ama_feat_dev/k44icgy/) are decentralizing the mixing process and creating the building blocks for supporting things like NFTs in a truly decentralized way.
- @davecgh hinted at pivoting to making [app development](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/1700xyi/decred_developer_ask_me_anything_ama_feat_dev/k45rwmq/) easier.

## Governance and Finances

In October the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 7,628 DCR worth $97K at October's average rate of $12.73. 8,412 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $107K at same rate.

[Treasury spend tx](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/dad857ec261237d51247d4bfae1a1ffb4348c8a7ed8933b2b877e6cac1d75436) mined in early October has been covered in the [previous issue](202309.md#governance).

As of Nov 1, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 873K DCR (11.4 million USD at $13.08).

Three proposals have finished voting in October:

- [Cake Wallet Integration Again](https://proposals.decred.org/record/b3bdacb) by @JoeGruff requesting $80,000 to integrate basic DCR functionality in [Cake Wallet](https://cakewallet.com/) was approved with 88% Yes and 59% ticket turnout.

- [Decred PR Proposal Phase Five](https://proposals.decred.org/record/0c04c6f) by @l1ndseymm requesting $48,000 for another year of public relations work as a team of 5 people was rejected with 53% Yes (missing the 60% threshold) and 55% ticket turnout.

- [Odaily Content Proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/b80040f) by @conniej requesting $15,000 for publishing 2 sponsored articles over 6 months and the corresponding social media exposure was rejected with 30% Yes and 28% turnout. The proposal was authorized for voting after ~2 months of inactivity.

The above proposals had no major updates since they were covered in [Politeia Digest 64](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue064/).

Voting for [Cake Wallet Integration](https://dcrdata.decred.org/proposal/b3bdacb776732b5b) and [Decred PR Phase 5](https://dcrdata.decred.org/proposal/0c04c6fcebac8c58) proposals [could not be started](https://matrix.to/#/!qYpAAClAYrHaUIGkLs:decred.org/$uKiSVmR0a3Z1q1-1gLfsaN7JIG-UAmZbZCJ8QoykU2M) normally on September 28th due to a [server error](https://matrix.to/#/!ueeciPqvqEsPyPCJkp:decred.org/$sig85UC6YA5Mo1hRA6_3AKcAWPs7ZPGLFrDf2CJ1Prs). The problem with Cake Wallet proposal was resolved in ~4 days. Decred PR proposal took one extra day to fix due to [bad data in the database](https://matrix.to/#/!qYpAAClAYrHaUIGkLs:decred.org/$3d1pE7I1_tsf_jiinZnTEvg7tHGYtFeWS_IaltRcdNA) that had to be located and manually removed.

The Monero Community Crowdfunding System (CCS) wallet was [drained](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/916) of the entire balance of 2,675 XMR (~ $450,000 USD) by an unknown attacker. The XMR in the wallet had been donated by community members to fund approved projects being completed by other community members, it was administered by developers luigi and fluffypony and it is not known how the attacker was able to access the funds. Funds were stolen on Sep 1 but it was not discovered until late September.

A long term Bitcoin Core developer has [announced](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-core-developer-antoine-riard-steps-back-lightning-network-dilemma) stepping away from Lightning Network work after a recent class of "replacement cycling" attacks has been discovered to allow theft of funds from payment channels, with no apparent fix that does not require changes to Bitcoin at the level of the consensus rules. For Antoine Riard this was the final straw, when it became clear that Lightning Network is not on a trajectory to become usable in the way it was originally intended.

THORswap, a decentralized exchange on the THORchain platform, put its front end into [maintenance](https://x.com/THORSwap/status/1710162462639575065) mode as a response to funds from the $475M FTX hack being exchanged from ETH to BTC on the platform. Around $120M was exchanged before THORswap went into maintenance mode, but the hacker still managed to [bridge](https://www.theblock.co/post/256127/elliptic-finds-apparent-russian-connection-in-laundering-of-ftx-stolen-funds) funds to THORchain using other venues. Around one week later THORswap [resumed](https://www.theblock.co/post/256301/thorswap-resumes-with-updated-terms-to-exclude-users-from-sanctioned-countries) front end services with a change to the terms of use forbidding users from countries sanctioned by the US, UK or European Union - and an unnamed chain surveillance partner to assist with identifying addresses associated with these jurisdictions. 

Thor Technologies (unrelated to THOR chain or swap) and founder David Chin lost their case with the SEC in a [default](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/20/sec-scores-default-win-against-thor-token-company-and-founder-david-chin/) judgment, the charges were brought in December 2022 for raising $2.6 million in an unregistered securities offering for the THOR token, which was supposed to have something to do with the gig economy. Thor Technologies already shut down in April 2019 blaming "regulatory issues".

The New York Attorney General has [brought](https://unchainedcrypto.com/ny-attorney-general-sues-crypto-firms-gemini-genesis-and-dcg-for-over-1-billion-fraud/) a case against Gemeni, Genesis and Digital Currency Group (DCG), accusing them of defrauding investors of more than $1 billion. The case centres on the "Gemini Earn" program which allowed customers to lend assets to the companies for a fixed rate of return, and it was promoted as a low-risk investment even though internal investigations from the time found that the financial position of the firms was precarious. The collapse of the program and losses suffered by investors are one of the points of friction in the ongoing dispute between the Winklevoss twins who operate Gemini, and Barry Silbert, the CEO of DCG.

Reddit [announced](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/reddit-is-phasing-out-community-points-blockchain-rewards) the end of its experiment with Community Points (MOON and BRICK tokens for the /r/cryptocurrency and /r/fortnite subreddits), and the prices for the tokens promptly plunged. The reason given for the decision is difficulty and resource costs associated with scaling the system to the rest of the platform's communities. The 3 year experiment started with tokens tradeable on Ethereum, then to reduce costs it was moved to Arbitrum Nova, an Ethereum Layer 2 - but reddit has decided to abandon the decentralized ledger aspect of any future Community Points alternative. 

It was [noted](https://twitter.com/Pledditor/status/1714610041699930439) that 3 of the moderators of /r/cryptocurrency who had early warning of the news used this opportunity to dump their MOONs, causing a 22% drop in price just before the news came out and the price declined 90%. These moderators were [removed](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/23/reddit-crypto-community-removes-moderators-accused-of-moon-insider-trading/) by the rest of the mod team, who stated an intent to keep the MOONs token going in some form on the subreddit.

Huobi exchange was hacked for 5,000 ETH (~$8M) but the hacker took Justin Sun's offer of a 5% bounty and a job as a security consultant for [returning](https://x.com/justinsuntron/status/1710687727686160676) the funds. 

The Wall Street Journal published a series of [articles](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/militants-behind-israel-attack-raised-millions-in-crypto-b9134b7a) about Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad which stated that the organisations were successfully raising millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency, which was apparently based on a mis-reading of the on chain data. [Chainalysis](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/10/19/hamas-crypto-funding-likely-overstated-chainalysis/) and Elliptic have indicated that their reading of the data is very different, with many of the entities caught up in the higher amounts being intermediaries with no direct links to terror funding. Nic Carter has been leading the criticism of the articles,  including with a [bounty](https://x.com/nic__carter/status/1717622001014067417) program for open source analyses funded with $10,500 initially then increased with further contributions by other funders and supplemented with other bounty [programs](https://x.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1719363225827922004). The WSJ have since [rolled back](https://x.com/nic__carter/status/1717997939140722758) some of the claims in the original article, but it is not clear if that has diminished the enthusiasm of the 104 Congressional representatives who [signed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/11/08/how-misinformation-on-hamas-and-crypto-fooled-nearly-20-of-congress/) a letter calling for enquiries into crypto fundraising by Hamas on the strength of the original article.

Su Zhu, of Three Arrows Capital infamy, was [arrested](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/29/three-arrows-capital-co-founder-zhu-arrested-in-singapore-airport-sentenced-four-months-in-prison) while trying to leave Singapore and sentenced to 4 months in prison as a consequence of failing to cooperate with the 3AC bankruptcy process.

NiceHash is ending its service for UK residents, according to [emails](https://www.reddit.com/r/NiceHash/comments/16tl5jg/nicehash_is_leaving_the_uk/) it sent to existing users in late September. Services to block UK users include the hashpower marketplace, mining pools and exchange - the organisation cited "recent regulation changes" as the motivating factor but did not give more specific information.
