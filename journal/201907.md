[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): Code maintenance, bug fixes, test infrastructure. 

New major versions of several main modules introduced to take advantage of recent improvements in other modules. Version 4 of the `rpcclient` [introduced](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1807) to make use of the benefits provided by the updated `dcrutil` and `chaincfg` modules. Version 2 of the `blockchain/stake` [introduced](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1803) for compatability with updated `dcrutil`, `chaincfg`, and `database` modules. This update also took the opportunity to address a few other needed changes to the staking API {SB: is "staking API" accurate? use other term?}. Version 2 of the `database` module [introduced](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1799) to make use of changes in `dcrutil`. This update breaks the tight coupling of `database` with `dcrutil` by introducing a new `BlockSerializer` interface and using it instead of `*dcrutil.Block` in the database interface API. The `dcrjson` module has also seen a new major version bump to v3. This version removes all dcrd RPC type support, instead focusing only on method and type registration. In order to improve backwards compatibility with dcrjson/v2, the API has been modified to register methods as interface{} instead of string. This allows different method string types to be used to key parameter types during registration and lookup, and will allow dcrjson/v2 to forward registrations of RPC methods to v3 without causing duplicate registrations errors for incompatible types. With the introduction of the new types package, the RPC API has been modified to replace concatenated hash blobs to JSON string arrays of hash strings. The RPC API major version is bumped to reflect this change. {SB: description of this last module update taken verbatim from the PR, should probably be shortened, given some context for the reader}

Four new [functions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1802) on the `Param` struct, which return new stake-related parameters: `VotesPerBlock`, `StakeValidationBeginHeight`, `StakeEnableHeight`, `TicketExpiryBlocks`. This will allow these parameters to be used directly as input to future interfaces. 

Dependency upgrades to: mgcs (go-storage) dependencies [updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1804) in preparation for upgrade to v1.1.0., JSON-RPC types [updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1789), Docker [updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1782) to use go 1.12.  


Merged:
* rpcclient: Introduce v4 module https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1807
  Version 4 of the `rpcclient` [introduced](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1807) in order to make use of the benefits provided by the recently updated `dcrutil` and `chaincfg` modules. Note that while `rpcclient` Version 4 is officially in the codebase, building dcrd from source will still produce binaries based on the Version 3 `rpcclient` module. 
* blockchain/stake: Introduce v2 module. https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1803 (related to new Version 4 `rpcclient` module? In order to make use of chaincfg/v2, dcrutil/v2, and database/v2, a new major version of the blockchain/stake module (blockchain/stake/v2) is [introduced](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1803) because blockchain/stake/v1 accepts and returns types from chaincfg/v1, dcrutil/v1, and database/v1 in its API. This was also used as an opportunity to address a few other items that require a new major version (SB: details on individual changes in PR). Finally, it should also be noted that this only introduces the new module and does not update anything to make use of it yet, so building the software will still produce binaries based on the v1 module.)
* database: Introduce v2 module https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1799 (SB: related to other changes to group together..In order to make use of dcrutil/v2, a new major version of the database module is required because database/v1 accepts and returns types from dcrutil/v1 in its API...Since a new major version is required, this also takes the opportunity break the tight coupling with dcrutil by introducing a new BlockSerializer interface and accepting it instead of *dcrutil.Block in the database interface API. Consequently, this introduces database/v2 which addresses the aforementioned items. Binaries still base on v1 module... 
* dcrjson: Introduce v3 and move types to module. https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1779 (This commit introduces a new major version of the dcrjson module which removes all dcrd RPC type support, instead focusing only on method and type registration....In order to improve backwards compatibility with dcrjson/v2, the API has been modified to register methods as interface{} instead of string. This allows different method string types to be used to key parameter types during registration and lookup, and will allow dcrjson/v2 to forward registrations of RPC methods to v3 without causing duplicate registrations errors for incompatible types.
* main: Add database/v2 override for tests. https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1806 (keeping tests up to date..)
* chaincfg: Fix merkle root of v1 simnet genesis block https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1805 (fix bug in simnet (hard fork change but OK because simnet)
* gcs: Prepare v1.1.0 https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1804 (updates gcs (go-storage) dependencies in preparation for upgrading to go-storage v1.1.0. Also optimizes the `AddSigScript` method by making use of the zero-alloc tokenizer now available in the `txscript/v2` module).
* chaincfg: Add stake params accessor funcs https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1802 (Four new functions on the `Params` struct (SB: purpose of this struct? High-levle meaning to reader?), which return some stake-related parameters (VotesPerBlock, StakeValidationBeginHeight, StakeEnableHeight, TicketExpiryBlocks). This will allow the parameters to be used directly as input to an interfact in the future). 
* chaincfg: Avoid block 1 subsidy codegen explosion. https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1801 (Fixes an issue where the go compiler was causing the package "weight" (size?) to explode to 7.7 MB. This improves the compiled size of the package by using code generation techniquest to optimize the memory layout and code transformation of the subsidy values each time a params functino is called"...the new size of the compiled package is 379dB, about 5% of the original size.
* hdkeychain: Prepare v2.0.1. https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1798 (not super notable?)
* main: Use rpcclient/v3. https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1795
* multi: Use decred fork of go-socks. https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1790 (This modifies the code to use the Decred fork of the go-socks module throughout and updates the affected modules to use the v1.0.0 release of the socks module.)
* main: Use latest JSON-RPC types. https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1789 (SB: minor upgrade worth mentioning?)
* mempool: remove unused error return value https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1785 (SB: bug fix)
* TravisCI: Use more portable module ver stripping. https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1784 (SB: minor script fix that allows it to work on mac)
* travis: drop docker and test directly https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1783 (SB: minor test improvement)
* docker: use go 1.12  https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1782 (update docker to use go 1.12)
* dcrutil: Alias amount types to v2 module https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1781 (SB more type fixing stuff..)

* [POC] Refactor startup to a finite state machine https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2130 (state machine work referenced in June DJ is ready for review)
* [POC] Refactor startup to a finite state machine https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2130
* [ln] Initial Version https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2107 (LAST comment 6/1. Any update? This is the first version of an embedded LN wallet UI on decrediton. Current features:

          Connect to initialized and unlocked ln wallets
          Fund/Withdraw funds from onchain ln wallet
          Open/Close channels
          Create invoices
          Send payments
          Due to current limitations of dcrlnd, this can only be used on wallets that
          have been previously unlocked.
            
          It also requires the user to open a regular wallet before connecting to a ln
          wallet, which is something we might wanna change in the future.
            
          For the moment, in order to enable support to LN, users need to manually edit
          the global decrediton config file to set "ln_enabled: true".
            
          It's likely that this can only be merged after updating the grpc and electron versions (which will come on a separate PR)

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): Work continues on the redesign of Politeia's interface. The other major task in July concerned the [integration](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/951) of tlog, from Google's open source [Trillian](https://github.com/google/trillian) data store on the backend as a replacement for git. tlog will improve scalability, allow records to be timestamped individually instead of in journals, and will allow for the a switch to a filesystem like [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) in future.

Decred Australia community has been building nicely. An [update](https://medium.com/@sahand.bagheri/decred-australia-building-a-community-brick-by-brick-89928041687e) shared last month recaps partnerships established, events organized, people attracted as well as next goals. This was covered in [June](201906.md)'s Media but turned out bigger than just an article.

## Governance

In July the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 15,517 DCR and spent 10,344 DCR. Using July's daily average DCR/USD rate of $28.97, this is $450K received and $300K spent. As these payments were for work completed in June, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the June average daily rate of $28.90 {hardly worth repeating with such low volatility ;-)} - in which case the USD spent figure is $448K. As of Aug 1, Treasury balance is 627,514 DCR (16.8 million USD at $26.75).

{do we need _received_ figure for prev month? rr: probably not, have removed}

In July, 2 new proposals were submitted: 

* [Decred Fundamental Metrics Research Proposal - Phase 1](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/78b50f218106f5de40f9bd7f604b048da168f2afbec32c8662722b70d62e4d36) by @checkmate, a new contributor, requesting $12,000 for 3 months work on research and social media presence, plus $2,000 for work completed prior to this ([monetary premiums article](https://medium.com/@_Checkmatey_/monetary-premiums-can-altcoins-compete-with-bitcoin-54c97a92c6d4)). Voting started on Jul 30.

* [TinyDecred: A Python Toolkit for Decred](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/20e967dad9e7398901decf3cfe0acf4e0853f6558a62607265c63fe791b8b124) by @buck54321, a contractor working on dcrdata for the last year, requests $8,000 for work already completed on TinyDecred, a set of tools for interacting with the Decred blockchain in Python.

[Issue 19](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/politeia-digest/blob/master/issue-019.md) of Politeia Digest has more detail on July's proposal activity.

A [data-set](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/pi-research/blob/master/data/comments-and-updown-votes/pi-users.csv) and [short report](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/pi-research/blob/master/analysis/comments-and-updown-votes/users-review.md) has been prepared which aggregates the Politeia data on the basis of username, producing accurate figures for how often each user has commented and voted, and how well their comments have scored. 

## Network

Hashrate: July's hashrate opened at ~503 Ph/s and closed ~583 Ph/s, bottoming at 319 Ph/s and peaking at 687 Ph/s throughout the month. Pool hashrate distribution as of Aug2: F2Pool 20.78%, UUPool 18.96%, lab.antpool.com 16.50%, Poolin 9.51%, BTC.com 7.29%, Luxor 2.20%, BeePool 0.14%, Coinmine 0.12%, suprnova 0.08% and others 24.42% per [dcrstats.com](https://dcrstats.com/pow). Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Sharp drop in hashrate 550-319 was observed on Jul 5 according to dcrstats.com, the hash rate quickly rose up again.There was a long some [discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!NNzHoaSdnsbZDQOXJr:decred.org/$156238052013967KGajR:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com) on the possible reasons for the drop and on its [accuracy](https://matrix.to/#/!NNzHoaSdnsbZDQOXJr:decred.org/$156245221914434sRKEL:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com).

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was 125.85 DCR (+5) per dcrstats.com. The price varied between 118.8-129.4 DCR. Locked amount was 4.86-5.04 million DCR, which corresponded to 48.5-49.61% of the available supply. 

The ticket prices got to the highest levels (129.46) since the sdiffalgorithm consensus chage. Dave gave us some [insight](https://matrix.to/#/!kdpEDksmOMNrlMqffD:decred.org/$156359151625133psHEo:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org) on if this could be considered an "ATH"

## Markets

In July DCR was trading between USD 25.20-35.64 / BTC 0.00262-0.00296. The average daily rate was $28.97.

After brefiely making a run for 13000 USD, Bitcoin prices went down and has been mostly bobbing the 10000 USD mark most of July.

## Relevant External

Chris Burniske of Placeholder VC (holders of Decred and Zcash) provided a good [summary](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/placeholder-considerations-resources-governance-and-legitimacy-in-nu4/34045) of the situation facing the Zcash community as the founders reward expires, advocating for a continuation of 20% block reward to project development for another 4 years, with a split of 70% to "Protocol Development" and 30% to "Growth Funds".

Zooko Wilcox published a [personal letter](https://medium.com/@zooko_25893/a-personal-letter-about-the-possibility-of-a-new-zcash-dev-fund-f6d30df64392) about the possibility of a new Zcash dev fund, which explains that he always knew that the time would come when funding would run out and create a problem that could only be solved through a "messy and difficult process" such as the Zcash community is currently going through. Zooko stated again that he cannot be the one to make the decision and that it should come from the community, but as the CEO of ECC he has considerable influence in the community, and the community has no established method of making decisions.

All of the various options being considered have been helpfully summarized in this [megathread](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/future-of-zcash-dev-funding-megathread-everything-in-one-place/34063). As Chris Burniske remarked in his post, the first question is how to make the decision about the decision in a way which is perceived as legitimate. Given time constraints Chris advocates the use of polling to gauge preference for the various options, with a final decision made using the ECC and Zcash Foundation 2-of-2 multisig. Zooko stated that the ECC will announce a method of decision-making in early Aug.

Nebulous, the company building the Sia network, announced the [completion](https://sia.tech/funding2019) of a $3.25 million seed round with participation by a number of venture capitalists. 

Funding has also been the subject of some discussion in the Ethereum community, with more [attention](https://research.circle.com/insights/the-great-ethereum-funding-debate) being paid to [EIP-2025](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2025.md), which would add 0.0055 ETH per block for 18 months (17k ETH in total) to fund ETH 1.X development (as the main developers focus on ETH 2.0). The block rewards would be used to pay back a loan which the teams working in 4 different areas would receive to multi-sig contract addresses.

As with any controversial Ethereum Improvement Proposal, it is difficult for outsiders to know if EIP-2025 will go anywhere. A [tweet](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1154733914881179648?s=20) from Vitalik stating that it seems to have little support probably indicates that it won't be included in the Istanbul hard fork.

Another Circle Research [article](https://research.circle.com/insights/degrees-of-architectural-decentralization-to-infura-and-beyond) published about Ethereum concerns the centrality of Infura, a service company created by Consensys which allows dpp developers to sidestep setting up and running their own nodes. The article considers the difficulty and increasing demands of running a full node (space requirements have increased 25-48% year to date) as causing a decrease in the number of full nodes from 12,000 in Dec 2018 to 8,000 in July 2019. Infura is welcome because it allows Ethereum developers to avoid the inconvenience of interfacing with the blockchain directly, but it introduces a central point of failure for the 50,000 dapps and developers who rely on it. Infura is in turn reliant on AWS services to run its nodes.

The /r/ethtrader [Donuts experiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/donuts), where subreddit participants earn points based on their subreddit karma and use these to participate in polls, is moving into another [phase](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/c3f1ku/the_next_phase_for_donuts/). Smart contracts have been prepared which will allow Donuts to be move to the Ethereum blockchain, and some reddit admins are facilitating this on the reddit end. As the donuts are being "decentralized", the polls are to become non-binding signal votes, due to fears in the community about on chain governance. This appears to be controversial choice, based on comments on the announcement, and there is some confusion about what the purpose of Donuts are.

Aragon [completed](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-aragon-network-vote-3/) its 3rd round of governance proposal voting, 11 proposals were submitted and 8 were approved for voting by the Aragon Association. 7 of these proposals were approved , all with 99% or greater yes votes, 4 were unanimous (with 1 or less ANT token voting no). ANT turnout was 2.6% average across the 8 proposals.

[AGP-64](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-64.md) signals support for Quiet Ending Voting, which would extend the duration of AGP voting if the outcome is flipped towards the end of the voting period. This is in response to the [observation](https://www.evanvanness.com/post/184616403861/aragon-vote-shows-the-perils-of-onchain-governance) that late voting by a whale had swayed the outcome of previous AGPs. This proposal does not specify a particular implementation but signals support for resources to be invested in developing quiet ending voting for Aragon.

[AGP-59](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-59.md) mandates a minimum length for discussion period on AGP submissions. [AGP-70](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-70.md) signals support for shifting management of the Nest grant program away from the Aragon Association and to a DAO, AGP-71 extended the budget of the Nest program by 600k DAI and 300k ANT. [AGP-73](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-73.md) is the biggest budget proposal, with further flock funding for Autark of 1.6 million DAI and 487k ANT. The rejected proposal called for development of a native mobile app for Aragon voting.

Dash [completed](https://blog.dash.org/the-dash-investment-foundation-supervisor-election-results-96a28309744b) the first annual elections for positions as supervisors of the Dash Investment Foundation, using some software custom [made](https://blog.dash.org/trust-protector-election-software-93ed67c7455b) for this purpose.

The 0x decentralized exchange protocol team [announced](https://blog.0xproject.com/shut-down-of-0x-exchange-v2-0-contract-and-migration-to-patched-version-6185097a1f39) that a security vulnerability had been reported by a 3rd-party security researcher, and shut down the exchange contract as a precaution. The 0x smart contract pipeline was patched and re-deployed the next day.
