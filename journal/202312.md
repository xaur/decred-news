## { Some Announcement }

{ _Add individual sections for high-impact announcements, such as consensus votes, software releases, milestones, major bugs, etc._ }


<a id="development"></a>

## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover notable dev work as recommended below._
  - _Step 1: Add every PR/commit in chronological order (oldest first)_
    - _this is for easier intermediate review_
  - _Step 2: Order/group changes "most released first":_
    - _changes released to end users_
    - _merged to master_
    - _in progress (work started)_
    - _discussions and future plans_
  - _Step 3: Organize further:_
    - _user-facing up top_
    - _dev stuff down below_
  - _Step 4: After dev review, group further and tidy_
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

}


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Developer and internal changes:

- Updated the [Docker image](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3214) to build with Go 1.21.5.
- Marked `cfilter` version 1 messages as [deprecated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3205) in the `wire` package. This is just general cleanup, since V1 `cfilter` messages are already invalid. V2 `cfilter` messages have been [the standard](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1906) since [DCP-5](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki) activated in Jan 2020.


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

- Modify the pruning procedure to [prune partial chains](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2309) instead of pruning entire trees. This does not have a functional change yet, but in the future will allow SPV clients to process chains asynchronously. { _dev? SPV chain sync_ }
- Only [request block notifications](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2310) after the wallet is fully synced. This solves a race issue where the wallet might try to look at blocks before the underlying `dcrd` instance was fully synced. The result would be missed transaction notifications and the wallet's balance to be wrong, requiring a rescan to be fixed. { _user: important_ }
- Fix the gRPC logger, which wasn't [correctly removing prefixes](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2313) when logging message arguments. This error [was caught](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/issues/2169) by a friendly passerby who is writing a custom golang linter. { _dev_ }
- Use Go 1.19 [atomic types](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2312) wherever possible. These types prevent misuse by only allowing access through the provided methods and guarantee proper use even if the variables are reorganized in the struct layout. { _dev_ }
- When the wallet is syncing in SPV mode, [process header batches in parallel](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2311). This resulted in a 32% faster sync on average when tested in the real world. { _user: important_ }
- If a peer gives the wallet a new block, ensure that block has a [known ancestor either in the main chain or a side chain](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2315). If no known ancestor exists, this means the wallet missed some blocks and should resync headers. Previously, the wallet only looked for ancestors in the main chain, instead of all side chains too. This caused `getHeaders` to run unecessarily often, especially for devs simulating large reorgs with side chains. { _dev_ }
- When the wallet is in SPV mode and the initial sync has already finished, [request headers from each newly connected peer](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2316). This speeds up re-syncing after initial sync when the local client has been offline for some time (for example, due to a flicking network connection) by ensuring any and all updated headers are requested immediately, instead of waiting until a new block is announced to begin the catchup process. { _user_ }
- Fixed an bug where a restored wallet would [miss discovering transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2319) if those transactions were in the tip block after restoring from seed. This was quite a rare bug, because having more blocks in the chain post-restoration would prevent the issue from being hit. The bug would've likely only impacted automated dev tests, although rescans would also have fixed the issue for any users who might've experienced the bug. { _dev or user? I can't decide._ }

In progress:

- Add [integration tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2318) to assert the correct behavior of restoring a wallet under various scenarios.


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

{ _Sources:_

- https://github.com/decred/decrediton/commits/master
- release branch
- #decrediton
- #hw-wallets

}

- { _I reviewed these sources. Several open PRs look like they "might" qualify for an In-Progress section, but nothing strongly called my name. Therefore, I'm good with completely eliminating the Decrediton section if you are._ }


### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software used by Voting Service Providers. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

- [Added documentation](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/458) for how a new VSP admin can get their VSP listed in Decrediton and on [decred.org/vsp](https://decred.org/vsp). This documentation is not aimed at the general user, and therefore has also been removed from [docs.decred.org](https://docs.decred.org).


### dcrpool

_[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool) is server software for running a Decred mining pool._

- Display the connected miners' [ip:ports](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/428) on the pool account page. This makes it a little bit easier to distinguish clients from each other.
- Allow dcrpool to [gracefully handle errors](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/431) if dcrd's `GetTxOut` method can't find an output for a given transaction.


### Lightning Network

_[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant low-cost transactions._

### cspp

_[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp) is a server for coordinating coin mixes using the CoinShuffle++ protocol. It is non-custodial, i.e. never holds any funds. CSPP is part of StakeShuffle, Decreds privacy system._

- Added [build flags](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/98) that allow an entirely standalone `csppsolver` executable to be built with the latest version of the [flint3 library](https://flintlib.org/downloads.html) embedded in it. Distributing such an executable removes the need to install flint3. { _I stole this text from 202302.md. Reads well, even if it's handwavey about what the actual headers are doing._ }

### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

In December the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 7,463 DCR worth $119K at December's average rate of $15.89. 8,427 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $134K at same rate.

A [treasury spend tx](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/bbe950023801d9a9a082b15374cb5b30385172431dec0961207b2adb7197e82d) was approved with 99.5% Yes votes and 58% turnout, and mined on Dec 19. It had 29 outputs making payments to contractors, ranging from 7.5 DCR to 2,182 DCR. Most of this DCR was likely paid for {billing month} work, at its billing exchange rate of ${} the TSpend is worth around ${}.

## Relevant External

{ _Story ideas:_

}

Ledger's Connect Kit library, used heavily by DeFi applications like SushiSwap, Balancer and Zapper to allow users to interact with their wallets, was hacked when a staff member's credentials were compromised and malicious code was introduced to the GitHub repository. This allowed the hacker to [steal](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/12/14/ledger-exploit-drained-484k-upended-defi-former-staffer-linked-to-malicious-code/) $484K from users who accessed their wallets during the critical 2 hour period before the red flag was raised and many of the DeFi protocols using the library paused operations amid a general [panic](https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1735308883160100996) about the safety of any Ethereum transaction made on the day of the attack.

As of Jan 1 2024 new regulations come into [effect](https://www.paulhastings.com/insights/client-alerts/digital-asset-reporting-is-here) which treat digital assets as cash in the sense that receiving more than $10,000 from a single recipient will mandate reporting the transaction event and the identity of the sender to the IRS on a Form 8300. This was a provision of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs (“Infrastructure Act”) that was passed in 2021, and it is widely seen as presenting a problematic increase in the level of admin work involved in receiving cryptocurrency as a business.

Tether has started [freezing](https://www.theblock.co/post/266872/tether-freezes-all-ofac-sanctioned-wallets-in-proactive-security-measure) the assets held by wallet addresses sanctioned by OFAC, and has also blacklisted the contract address for Tornado Cash. Tether has also been happily "[onboarding](https://www.theblock.co/post/267973/tether-weve-onboarded-fbi-secret-service-to-our-platform)" the US Secret Service and FBI to their platform, while bragging about the 435 million USDT it has so far frozen at law enforcement's behest.

Binance has been [running](https://www.ft.com/content/47fe6542-d000-4051-86d9-feb0055697da) half-day courses in France that introduce people to blockchain concepts and software like Metamask, and get them to sign up to Binance to receive their "NFT diploma", and in some of the poorer regions which they have targeted attendees are being forced to sign up for this "education" as part of a state-sponsored retraining effort. This is one of the outcomes of French PM Macron's relatively welcoming attitude towards the company which saw Binance pledge to invest 100 million euros in the country's burgeoning crypto scene in 2021, as detailed in [this article](https://www.ft.com/content/47fe6542-d000-4051-86d9-feb0055697da).







{ _Hints (all optional):_

_1. Besides dramatic "epic fails", try to also report "epic wins" in areas relevant to Decred. Balance is good and we can learn from both._

_2. Order the stories as follows:_

- _Crypto L1 tech: PoW, ASIC resistance, full nodes, network security, etc._
- _Crypto L2+ tech: "Smart" contracts, DEX projects_
- _Crypto governance, finances, transparency, funding, chain forks, community splits_
- _Relevant exchanges and websites_
- _Regulations, privacy, security_
- _Fun stuff_
