## { Some Announcement }

{ _Add individual sections for high-impact announcements, such as consensus votes, software releases, milestones, major bugs, etc._ }

## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{

- _For each project, cover notable dev work as recommended below._
  - _Step 1: Add every PR/commit in chronological order (oldest first)_
    - _this is for easier intermediate review_
  - _Step 2: Order/group changes "most released first":_
    - _changes released to end users_
    - _merged to master_
    - _in progress (work started)_
    - _discussions and future plans_
  - _Step 3: Organize further:_
    - _user-facing up top_
    - _dev stuff down below_
  - _Step 4: After dev review, group further and tidy_
- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Developer and internal changes:

- Updated the [Docker image](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3214) to build with Go 1.21.5.
- Marked `cfilter` version 1 messages as [deprecated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3205) in the `wire` package. This is just general cleanup, since V1 `cfilter` messages are already invalid. V2 `cfilter` messages have been [the standard](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1906) since [DCP-5](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki) activated in Jan 2020.


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

- Modify the pruning procedure to [prune partial chains](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2309) instead of pruning entire trees. This does not have a functional change yet, but in the future will allow SPV clients to process chains asynchronously. { _dev? SPV chain sync_ }
- Only [request block notifications](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2310) after the wallet is fully synced. This solves a race issue where the wallet might try to look at blocks before the underlying `dcrd` instance was fully synced. The result would be missed transaction notifications and the wallet's balance to be wrong, requiring a rescan to be fixed. { _user: important_ }
- Fix the gRPC logger, which wasn't [correctly removing prefixes](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2313) when logging message arguments. This error [was caught](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/issues/2169) by a friendly passerby who is writing a custom golang linter. { _dev_ }
- Use Go 1.19 [atomic types](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2312) wherever possible. These types prevent misuse by only allowing access through the provided methods and guarantee proper use even if the variables are reorganized in the struct layout. { _dev_ }
- When the wallet is syncing in SPV mode, [process header batches in parallel](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2311). This resulted in a 32% faster sync on average when tested in the real world. { _user: important_ }
- If a peer gives the wallet a new block, ensure that block has a [known ancestor either in the main chain or a side chain](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2315). If no known ancestor exists, this means the wallet missed some blocks and should resync headers. Previously, the wallet only looked for ancestors in the main chain, instead of all side chains too. This caused `getHeaders` to run unecessarily often, especially for devs simulating large reorgs with side chains. { _dev_ }
- When the wallet is in SPV mode and the initial sync has already finished, [request headers from each newly connected peer](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2316). This speeds up re-syncing after initial sync when the local client has been offline for some time (for example, due to a flicking network connection) by ensuring any and all updated headers are requested immediately, instead of waiting until a new block is announced to begin the catchup process. { _user_ }
- Fixed an bug where a restored wallet would [miss discovering transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2319) if those transactions were in the tip block after restoring from seed. This was quite a rare bug, because having more blocks in the chain post-restoration would prevent the issue from being hit. The bug would've likely only impacted automated dev tests, although rescans would also have fixed the issue for any users who might've experienced the bug. { _dev or user? I can't decide._ }

In progress:

- Add [integration tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2318) to assert the correct behavior of restoring a wallet under various scenarios.

Daily [mix volume](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=privacy-participation&bin=day&axis=time) varied between {n}-{n}K DCR.


### Lightning Network

Decred's [Lightning Network](https://ln-map.jholdstock.uk/) explorer saw {} nodes (+{}), {} channels (+{}) with a total capacity of {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}), as of {date}. These stats are different for each node. For example, @karamble's node reported {} nodes (+{}), {} channels (+{}) and {} DCR (+{}) capacity on same day {}.
