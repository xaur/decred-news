## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Developer and internal changes:

- Updated the [Docker image](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3214) to build with Go 1.21.5.
- Marked `cfilter` version 1 messages as [deprecated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3205) in the `wire` package. This is just general cleanup, since V1 `cfilter` messages are already invalid. V2 `cfilter` messages have been [the standard](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1906) since [DCP-5](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki) activated in Jan 2020.

In progress:

- Introduce [P2P mixing messages](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3066) to the `wire` protocol


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

User-facing changes:

- Only [request block notifications](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2310) after the wallet is fully synced. This solves a race issue where the wallet might try to look at blocks before the underlying dcrd instance was fully synced. This could happen when dcrwallet is started very quickly after dcrd (for example, from within Decrediton). The result would be missed transaction notifications and the wallet's balance to be wrong, requiring a rescan to be fixed.
- When the wallet is syncing in SPV mode, [process header batches in parallel](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2311). This resulted in a 32% faster sync on average when tested in the real world.
- When the wallet is in SPV mode and the initial sync has already finished, [request headers from each newly connected peer](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2316). This speeds up re-syncing after initial sync when the local client has been offline for some time (for example, due to an intermittent network connection) by ensuring any and all new headers are requested immediately, instead of waiting until a new block is announced to begin the catchup process.
- Fixed a bug where a restored wallet would [miss discovering transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2319) if those transactions were in the tip block after restoring from seed. This was quite a rare bug, because having more blocks in the chain post-restoration (common case) would prevent the issue from being hit. The bug would've likely only impacted automated dev tests, although rescans would also have fixed the issue for any users who might've experienced the bug.

Internal and developer changes:

- Modify the pruning procedure to [prune partial sidechains](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2309) instead of pruning entire trees. This does not have a functional change yet, but in the future will allow SPV clients to process chains asynchronously.
- Use Go 1.19 [atomic types](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2312) wherever possible. These types prevent misuse by only allowing access through the provided methods and guarantee proper use even if the variables are reorganized in the struct layout.
- If a peer gives the wallet a new block, ensure that block has a [known ancestor either in the main chain or a side chain](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2315). If no known ancestor exists, this means the wallet missed some blocks and should resync headers. Previously, the wallet only looked for ancestors in the main chain, instead of all side chains too. This caused `getHeaders` to run unnecessarily often, especially for devs simulating large reorgs with side chains.
- Fix the gRPC logger, which wasn't [correctly removing prefixes](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2313) when logging message arguments. This error [was caught](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/issues/2169) by a friendly passerby who is writing a custom golang linter.

In progress:

- Add [integration tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2318) to assert the correct behavior of restoring a wallet under various scenarios that were known to cause missed transactions. These tests make use of the upcoming [automation and testing framework](https://github.com/decred/dcrtest/pull/20) for operating a dcrwallet binary through its JSON-RPC and gRPC interfaces.
- Add [batched fetching of compact filters](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2314) to further [speed up syncing in SPV mode](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/issues/2289). This change depends on a related [change in dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3211) enabling the full nodes to serve the batched data to light SPV clients.


### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software used by Voting Service Providers. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

- [Added documentation](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/458) for how a new VSP admin can get their VSP listed in Decrediton and on [decred.org/vsp](https://decred.org/vsp). This documentation is not aimed at the general user, and therefore has also been removed from [docs.decred.org](https://docs.decred.org).


### dcrpool

_[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool) is server software for running a Decred mining pool._

- Display the connected miners' [IP and port](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/428) on the pool account page. This makes it a little bit easier to distinguish clients from each other.
- Allow dcrpool to [gracefully handle errors](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/431) if dcrd's `GetTxOut` method can't find an output for a given transaction.


### Lightning Network

_[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant low-cost transactions._

- Added automatic closing of channels that [have not been reestablished for some time](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/196). Normally peers keep their channels healthy by "reestablishing" them. If channel peer is seen online for some time but it is not sending a message to reestablish the channel, such channel is a good candidate for being force closed, because it is likely the remote peer has lost the ability to use the channel (for example, due to restoring the node after data loss without the use of an [SCB backup file](https://docs.decred.org/lightning-network/backups/)). By default, if channel's remote counterparty is seen online for 72 hours without reestablishing the channel, it will be auto closed. This should be a reasonable compromise between not closing channels too fast on hubs (that are online 24/7) and ephemeral nodes (that may be online only for an hour or two a day). Integration test has been added to assert the correct behavior.


### cspp

_[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp) is a server for coordinating coin mixes using the CoinShuffle++ protocol. It is non-custodial, i.e. never holds any funds. CSPP is part of StakeShuffle, Decred's privacy system._

- Updated [C headers](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/98) to support the [third major version](https://flintlib.org/doc/history.html#flint-3-0-0) of the fast math library `flint` (released October 2023). Newer versions of `flint` may provide performance and other improvements to the CSPP server.


### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

Changes backported to the next v0.6.x release:

- Fixed a bug where a trade could [get stuck](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2622) after a server disconnect. The full list of affected markets is unknown, but it is known that the bug affected LTC/DCR market and did not affect the DCR/BTC market.

Market maker bots:

- Implemented low-level [CEX management functions](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2568): deposit, withdraw, and balance tracking. Automatic rebalancing has been added to the simple arbitrage strategy where the bot initiates deposits and withdrawals to/from the CEX to maintain the configured balances. Binance is the first CEX supported by this functionality.
- Modified Binance code to track 1,000 [order book entries](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2627) instead of 20.

General client changes:

- Added display of [expired unrefunded bonds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2626) on DEX Settings view. When a bond expires it can be refunded to get the funds back.
- Fixed a rare [race condition](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2630) when handling [preimage requests](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/blob/2f6cae0917fca97ec0fa979f367cff69655def33/spec/orders.mediawiki#order-commitment).
- Minor UI fixes.

Other:

- Updated [dex.decred.org footer](https://github.com/decred/dexweb/pull/39) to show more supported assets.

In progress highlights:

- Switching to [native USDC on Polygon](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2629).
- Build environment for creating a standalone [Windows desktop app](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2635) and an installer for it.
- @buck54321 asked on Twitter [which coins and features](https://twitter.com/blockchainbuck/status/1732515860156199038) the community would want to see developed in the future, and [which USDC pairs](https://twitter.com/blockchainbuck/status/1734048766850683051) are the most wanted.


### Cryptopower

_[Cryptopower](https://github.com/crypto-power/cryptopower) is a multi-coin desktop GUI wallet for DCR, BTC, and LTC. It runs in a privacy-preserving light SPV mode without needing full blockchains, supports Decred staking, mixing, voting, and other unique features._

<a id="governance-and-finances"></a>

## Governance and Finances

In December the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 7,467 DCR worth $119K at December's average rate of $15.89. 8,427 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $134K at same rate.

A [treasury spend tx](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/bbe950023801d9a9a082b15374cb5b30385172431dec0961207b2adb7197e82d) was approved with 99.5% Yes votes and 58% turnout, and mined on Dec 19. It had 29 outputs making payments to contractors, ranging from 7.5 DCR to 2,182 DCR. Most of this DCR was likely paid for October and November work. Estimating the average billing exchange rate for the two months at $13.54, the billed amount in this TSpend represents around $114K USD equivalent.

As of Jan 1, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 870.9K DCR (15.7 million USD at $17.98).

Two proposals were submitted and approved in December:

- [Bug Bounty Program 2024](https://proposals.decred.org/record/a1fd5dd) by @jholdstock requested a budget of $105,000, split between $100,000 for bounty payments and $5,000 for administrative costs. In practice, only a small fraction of the requested budget has been used in previous iterations. The proposal reported that the expenses for the last 18 months were $415 paid for bounties and $1,750 for the operations. Overall the program has spent around $11K since its launch in 2019. The proposal has been approved with 98% Yes and a very high 74% turnout.

- [Decred Video Content 2024](https://proposals.decred.org/record/49cf2e1) by @phoenixgreen requested a budget of $71,000 for the creation and dissemination of video content for 2024. This proposal has been approved with 85% Yes and 64% turnout.

One proposal author reported a problem with purchasing [proposal credits](https://matrix.to/#/!qYpAAClAYrHaUIGkLs:decred.org/$elsLkiZbjOz5Pyx42S6e3HPk_4gnkoVpK8J_-qNhqJM) but it was resolved within a few days. A November issue with the registration fee not getting detected [persisted](https://matrix.to/#/!qYpAAClAYrHaUIGkLs:decred.org/$5SiSLy_z6wCTEhGzKif9rgGjKo-kOPMNBROt3i_dRqs) in December, and it is unknown if it affects just one unlucky new account or possibly others.

See [Politeia Digest issue 65](https://www.cypherpunktimes.com/politeia-digest-september-27-december-12-2023/) for more details on the month's proposals.

PD's publishing workflow has been reworked to improve reach and engagement: the main release channel is now [Cypherpunk Times](https://www.cypherpunktimes.com/politeia-digest-september-27-december-12-2023/) (main link is posted on Twitter and other places), Medium release is now posted in [Decred's main publication](https://medium.com/decred/politeia-digest-65-september-27-december-12-2023-984c12c31091) (instead of the lesser known [Politeia Digest](https://medium.com/politeia-digest) publication), and companion [Twitter threads](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1737514771954471033) are now being produced so that the highlights can be consumed without leaving Twitter.

## Network

This section tracks key health metrics of the Decred infrastructure.


### Mining

December's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) opened at ~5.5 TH/s and closed ~10.2 TH/s, bottoming at 3.8 TH/s and peaking at 11.6 TH/s throughout the month.

![Decred hashrate is seeking a new equilibrium after the initial influx of GPU miners](../img/202312.08.720.png)

_Image: Decred hashrate is seeking a new equilibrium after the initial influx of GPU miners_

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by Jan 7: [miningandco.com](https://decred.miningandco.com/) 26%, [pooltronic.tech](https://decred.pooltronic.tech/) 21%, [gopool.cash](https://dcr.gopool.cash/) 2.7%, [losmuchachos.digital](https://losmuchachos.digital/) 1.3%, and 49% of blocks were not identified by [miningpoolstats.stream](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred).

### Staking

[Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between 234-243 DCR.

![Ticket price has been very stable in December](../img/202312.10.720.png)

_Image: Ticket price has been very stable in December_

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) was 9.74-9.82 million DCR, meaning that 62.0-62.6% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&scale=linear&bin=day&axis=time) in proof of stake.

![DCR locked in tickets is staying near its ATH](../img/202312.11.720.png)

### VSP Staking

The [14 listed VSPs](https://decred.org/vsp/) collectively managed ~5,750 (-100) live tickets, which was 14.0% of the ticket pool (-0.3%) as of Jan 1.

The biggest gainers of December were [vote.dcr-swiss.ch](https://vote.dcr-swiss.ch) (+290 tickets or +105%) and [vsp.stakeminer.com](https://vsp.stakeminer.com/) (+67 tickets or +11%).

## Ecosystem


### Mining Pools

- [losmuchachos.digital](https://losmuchachos.digital/) has been launched, it is a Germany based DCR mining pool supporting the PPLNS payment model with a pool fee of 3%.

- [dcr.gopool.cash](https://dcr.gopool.cash/) has been spotted. [MiningPoolStats](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) reports that the Brazil based pool uses the PPLNS model with a fee of 1%. DCR is one of the [15 coins](https://miningpoolstats.stream/gopool.cash_pools) supported by the pool.

- There are (at least) 5 public mining pools now, all running [dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool) software.


### Exchanges

- All trading activity on Bittrex Global has been [terminated](https://twitter.com/BittrexGlobal/status/1731736725393699094) according to the shutdown plan published on [November 20th](https://twitter.com/BittrexGlobal/status/1726652430673121310). If our interpretation of chain activity is correct, the amount held at Bittrex when the trading stopped (December 4th) was [~17.5K DCR](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/d44e9f656bc3f376ff5814b9088b6c6de2718569d532b0dae1d7aec0e0e8f51b), and it looks like withdrawals have been working smoothly.

- [MEXC](https://www.mexc.com/) has been [added](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1158) to [decred.org Exchanges](https://decred.org/exchanges/) list after DCR withdrawals were [confirmed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/1157) to work. The exchange works over VPNs and allows some trading without KYC. MEXC added spot DCR/USDT market back in [June 2019](https://twitter.com/MEXC_Official/status/1143851087167758337) and 5x leveraged DCR/USDT pair in [December 2020](https://twitter.com/MEXC_Official/status/1334707659900035075), but there was little community feedback to confirm it is working.

- MEXC attracted some controversy after several users reported [seizure of funds](https://cointelegraph.com/news/traders-report-frozen-assets-account-blocks-mexc), account freezing, and withdrawals getting blocked. MEXC denied all claims in their [response](https://twitter.com/MEXC_Official/status/1738767532004434018). Two common patterns in the reports were very profitable leveraged trading and large withdrawals, both getting flagged as "abnormal" activity by MEXC. We cannot verify if the reports are true, but it's a good reminder to always do your own research and be very careful when dealing with custodial services.

- DCR withdrawals on Poloniex and HTX continued to be suspended for a total of about 1.5 months and have not been fixed in December, based on the information published on their [support](https://support.poloniex.com/hc/en-us/) [sites](https://www.htx.com/support/en-us/) and one user report in the #trading channel. All withdrawals, including DCR, were suspended in November in response to the [two hacks](202311.md#ecosystem) on these exchanges.

- Indian financial authorities announced the decision to [block URLs of 9 offshore exchanges](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/12/29/indias-local-crypto-and-web3-advocacy-body-asked-for-action-against-offshore-entities-source/) for not complying with local AML regulations. If the block will be implemented, accessing DCR markets on Binance, KuCoin, and other exchanges from India will become more difficult.


### Wallets

- Users of hardware wallet [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) fell victim to a [supply chain attack](https://www.ledger.com/blog/security-incident-report) on December 14th. A compromised [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) account of a former Ledger employee was used by an attacker to upload a malicious version of the Ledger Connect Kit library used by many DApps, which tricked EVM DApp users into signing transactions that drain their wallets. The vulnerability was patched quickly, but it took around ~5 hours for the fix to propagate. The exploit was limited to third party DApps which use the library, it did not affect the integrity of Ledger hardware or Ledger Live. Ledger [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1737457365526470665) that around $600K worth of assets has been affected and promised to make victims whole if they [claim](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/15580506579101) refunds (this process requires ID verification). To the best of our knowledge, no DCR wallets were affected by the exploit.

- [Guarda](https://guarda.com/) has been [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1161) from the list of known-to-work [wallets at decred.org](https://decred.org/wallets/) after several users [complained](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/18s54fm/help_importing_a_private_key/) that DCR was not working for 3 months. Timing suggests Guarda's DCR wallet stopped working around September 2023 because they failed to upgrade to Decred [v1.8.0](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.8.0) (released June 13th, 2023) and missed the hardfork (completed [September 1st](https://dcrdata.decred.org/block/794369), 2023). A person from Guarda [confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/18s54fm/help_importing_a_private_key/kf9n3pj/) that DCR is still considered a supported asset, but they're working on "some issues post-Decred's network upgrade". Until that is fixed, Guarda users can [export the private key](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/18s54fm/help_importing_a_private_key/kfbw3f6/) and import it in another wallet like dcrwallet or Exodus.

> Custodial wallets will require KYC/AML in the U.S. Full node wallets are not feasible for normal users for $BTC or $ETH. Others are questionable too. Decred DEX has struck a balance, using SPV technology to reduce 100s of GBs to < 4GB for BTC, with good privacy and sync times.
> 
> For $ETH, there's a no-privacy culture based on infrastructure providers (infura etc.). We've improved upon this slightly by enabling multiple infrastructure providers simultaneously. Full information about wallet activity would require collaboration between providers.
> 
> Our $DCR, $LTC, and $BCH wallets are also SPV, so good privacy and sync times there too. #Polygon has a multi-provider wallet like $ETH. All other wallets are full node, which is fine, since they are not Bitcoin, though $ZEC full node is still challenging.
> 
> Financial self-sovereignty MUST be an option for everybody. Decred DEX is battling to keep it possible. We've still got work to do, but is any other project sticking to blockchain principles like Decred DEX?
> 
> Did I mention that our wallet has new privacy options? We've added #Decred mixing, fully integrated with trading so that swap redemptions are re-mixed, adding to the (already huge) anonymity set. #Zcash is going shielded-by-default too, unified addresses and all.

## Relevant External

Ledger's Connect Kit library, used heavily by DeFi applications like SushiSwap, Balancer and Zapper to allow users to interact with their wallets, was hacked when a staff member's credentials were compromised and malicious code was introduced to the GitHub repository. This allowed the hacker to [steal](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/12/14/ledger-exploit-drained-484k-upended-defi-former-staffer-linked-to-malicious-code/) $484K from users who accessed their wallets during the critical 2-hour period before the red flag was raised and many of the DeFi protocols using the library paused operations amid a general [panic](https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1735308883160100996) about the safety of any Ethereum transaction made on the day of the attack.

As of Jan 1 2024 new regulations come into [effect](https://www.paulhastings.com/insights/client-alerts/digital-asset-reporting-is-here) which treat digital assets as cash in the sense that receiving more than $10,000 "in one transaction (or a series of related transactions)" will mandate reporting the transaction event and the identity of the sender to the IRS on a Form 8300. This was a provision of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ("Infrastructure Act") that was passed in 2021, and it is widely seen as presenting a [problematic](https://cointelegraph.com/news/irs-rules-10k-crypto-transactions-2024) increase in the level of admin work involved in receiving cryptocurrency as a business.

Tether has started [freezing](https://www.theblock.co/post/266872/tether-freezes-all-ofac-sanctioned-wallets-in-proactive-security-measure) the assets held by wallet addresses sanctioned by OFAC, and has also blacklisted the contract address for Tornado Cash. Tether has also been happily "[onboarding](https://www.theblock.co/post/267973/tether-weve-onboarded-fbi-secret-service-to-our-platform)" the US Secret Service and FBI to their platform, while bragging about the 435 million USDT it has so far frozen at law enforcement's behest.

Binance has been [running](https://www.ft.com/content/47fe6542-d000-4051-86d9-feb0055697da) half-day courses in France that introduce people to blockchain concepts and software like Metamask, and get them to sign up to Binance to receive their "NFT diploma", and in some of the poorer regions which they have targeted attendees are being forced to sign up for this "education" as part of a state-sponsored retraining effort. This is one of the outcomes of French PM Macron's relatively welcoming attitude towards the company which saw Binance pledge to invest 100 million euros in the country's burgeoning crypto scene in 2021, as detailed in [this article](https://www.ft.com/content/47fe6542-d000-4051-86d9-feb0055697da).

That's all for December. Thank you for reading!
