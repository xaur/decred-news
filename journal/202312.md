- _Add sections for any other project with notable activity._
- _Drop sections without notable updates._

}


### dcrd

_[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Developer and internal changes:

- Updated the [Docker image](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3214) to build with Go 1.21.5.
- Marked `cfilter` version 1 messages as [deprecated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/3205) in the `wire` package. This is just general cleanup, since V1 `cfilter` messages are already invalid. V2 `cfilter` messages have been [the standard](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1906) since [DCP-5](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki) activated in Jan 2020.


### dcrwallet

_[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet apps._

- Modify the pruning procedure to [prune partial chains](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2309) instead of pruning entire trees. This does not have a functional change yet, but in the future will allow SPV clients to process chains asynchronously. { _dev? SPV chain sync_ }
- Only [request block notifications](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2310) after the wallet is fully synced. This solves a race issue where the wallet might try to look at blocks before the underlying `dcrd` instance was fully synced. The result would be missed transaction notifications and the wallet's balance to be wrong, requiring a rescan to be fixed. { _user: important_ }
- Fix the gRPC logger, which wasn't [correctly removing prefixes](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2313) when logging message arguments. This error [was caught](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/issues/2169) by a friendly passerby who is writing a custom golang linter. { _dev_ }
- Use Go 1.19 [atomic types](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2312) wherever possible. These types prevent misuse by only allowing access through the provided methods and guarantee proper use even if the variables are reorganized in the struct layout. { _dev_ }
- When the wallet is syncing in SPV mode, [process header batches in parallel](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2311). This resulted in a 32% faster sync on average when tested in the real world. { _user: important_ }
- If a peer gives the wallet a new block, ensure that block has a [known ancestor either in the main chain or a side chain](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2315). If no known ancestor exists, this means the wallet missed some blocks and should resync headers. Previously, the wallet only looked for ancestors in the main chain, instead of all side chains too. This caused `getHeaders` to run unecessarily often, especially for devs simulating large reorgs with side chains. { _dev_ }
- When the wallet is in SPV mode and the initial sync has already finished, [request headers from each newly connected peer](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2316). This speeds up re-syncing after initial sync when the local client has been offline for some time (for example, due to a flicking network connection) by ensuring any and all updated headers are requested immediately, instead of waiting until a new block is announced to begin the catchup process. { _user_ }
- Fixed an bug where a restored wallet would [miss discovering transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2319) if those transactions were in the tip block after restoring from seed. This was quite a rare bug, because having more blocks in the chain post-restoration would prevent the issue from being hit. The bug would've likely only impacted automated dev tests, although rescans would also have fixed the issue for any users who might've experienced the bug. { _dev or user? I can't decide._ }

In progress:

- Add [integration tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2318) to assert the correct behavior of restoring a wallet under various scenarios.


### Decrediton

_[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

{ _Sources:_

- https://github.com/decred/decrediton/commits/master
- release branch
- #decrediton
- #hw-wallets

}

- { _I reviewed these sources. Several open PRs look like they "might" qualify for an In-Progress section, but nothing strongly called my name. Therefore, I'm good with completely eliminating the Decrediton section if you are._ }


### vspd

_[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd) is server software used by Voting Service Providers. A VSP votes on behalf of its users 24/7 and cannot steal funds._

- [Added documentation](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/458) for how a new VSP admin can get their VSP listed in Decrediton and on [decred.org/vsp](https://decred.org/vsp). This documentation is not aimed at the general user, and therefore has also been removed from [docs.decred.org](https://docs.decred.org).


### dcrpool

_[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool) is server software for running a Decred mining pool._

- Display the connected miners' [ip:ports](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/428) on the pool account page. This makes it a little bit easier to distinguish clients from each other.
- Allow dcrpool to [gracefully handle errors](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/431) if dcrd's `GetTxOut` method can't find an output for a given transaction.


### Lightning Network

_[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) is Decred's Lightning Network node software. LN enables instant low-cost transactions._

{ _Sources:_

}

- {}


### cspp

_[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp) is a server for coordinating coin mixes using the CoinShuffle++ protocol. It is non-custodial, i.e. never holds any funds. CSPP is part of StakeShuffle, Decreds privacy system._

- Added [build flags](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/98) that allow an entirely standalone `csppsolver` executable to be built with the latest version of the [flint3 library](https://flintlib.org/downloads.html) embedded in it. Distributing such an executable removes the need to install flint3. { _I stole this text from 202302.md. Reads well, even if it's handwavey about what the actual headers are doing._ }

### DCRDEX

_[DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) is a non-custodial, privacy-respecting exchange for trustless trading, powered by atomic swaps._

{ _Sources:_

- #dexdev
- #dex

}

Changes backported to the next v0.6.x release:

- Fixed a bug where a trade could [get stuck](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2622) after a server disconnect. The full list of affected markets is unknown, but it is known that the bug affected LTC/DCR market and did not affect the DCR/BTC market.

Market maker bots:

- Implemented low-level [CEX management functions](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2568): deposit, withdraw, and balance tracking. Automatic rebalancing has been added to the simple arbitrage strategy where the bot initiates deposits and withdrawals to/from the CEX to maintain the configured balances. Binance is the first CEX supported by this functionality.
- Modified Binance code to track 1,000 [order book entries](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2627) instead of 20.

General client changes:

- Added display of [expired unrefunded bonds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2626) on DEX Settings view. When a bond expires it can be refunded to get the funds back.
- Fixed a rare [race condition](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2630) when handling [preimage requests](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/blob/2f6cae0917fca97ec0fa979f367cff69655def33/spec/orders.mediawiki#order-commitment).
- Minor UI fixes. { 2618, 2644, 2649 }
- { _omitting minor changes: 2645 (desktop dep bump), 2646 (i18n)_ }

Other:

- Updated [dex.decred.org footer](https://github.com/decred/dexweb/pull/39) to show more supported assets.

In progress highlights:

- Switching to [native USDC on Polygon](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2629).
- Build environment for creating a standalone [Windows desktop app](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/2635) and an installer for it.

In December the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 7,463 DCR worth $119K at December's average rate of $15.89. 8,427 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $134K at same rate.

A [treasury spend tx](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/bbe950023801d9a9a082b15374cb5b30385172431dec0961207b2adb7197e82d) was approved with 99.5% Yes votes and 58% turnout, and mined on Dec 19. It had 29 outputs making payments to contractors, ranging from 7.5 DCR to 2,182 DCR. Most of this DCR was likely paid for {billing month} work, at its billing exchange rate of ${} the TSpend is worth around ${}.

## Ecosystem


### Mining Pools

- [losmuchachos.digital](https://losmuchachos.digital/) has been launched, it is a Germany based DCR mining pool supporting the PPLNS payment model with a pool fee of 3%.

- [dcr.gopool.cash](https://dcr.gopool.cash/) has been spotted. [MiningPoolStats](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) reports that the Brazil based pool uses the PPLNS model with a fee of 1%. DCR is one of the [15 coins](https://miningpoolstats.stream/gopool.cash_pools) supported by the pool.

- There are (at least) 5 public mining pools now, all running [dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool) software.


### Exchanges

- All trading activity on Bittrex Global has been [terminated](https://twitter.com/BittrexGlobal/status/1731736725393699094) according to the shutdown plan published on [November 20th](https://twitter.com/BittrexGlobal/status/1726652430673121310). If our interpretation of chain activity is correct, the amount held at Bittrex when the trading stopped (December 4th) was [~17.5K DCR](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/d44e9f656bc3f376ff5814b9088b6c6de2718569d532b0dae1d7aec0e0e8f51b), and it looks like withdrawals have been working smoothly.

- [MEXC](https://www.mexc.com/) has been [added](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1158) to [decred.org Exchanges](https://decred.org/exchanges/) list after DCR withdrawals were [confirmed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/1157) to work. The exchange works over VPNs and allows some trading without KYC. MEXC added spot DCR/USDT market back in [June 2019](https://twitter.com/MEXC_Official/status/1143851087167758337) and 5x leveraged DCR/USDT pair in [December 2020](https://twitter.com/MEXC_Official/status/1334707659900035075), but there was little community feedback to confirm it is working.

- MEXC attracted some controversy after several users reported [seizure of funds](https://cointelegraph.com/news/traders-report-frozen-assets-account-blocks-mexc), account freezing, and withdrawals getting blocked. MEXC denied all claims in their [response](https://twitter.com/MEXC_Official/status/1738767532004434018). Two common patterns in the reports were very profitable leveraged trading or large withdrawals, both getting flagged as "abnormal" activity by MEXC. We cannot verify if the reports are true, but it's a good reminder to always do your own research and be very careful when dealing with custodial services.

- DCR withdrawals on Poloniex and HTX continued to be suspended for a total of about 1.5 months and have not been fixed in December, based on the information published on their [support](https://support.poloniex.com/hc/en-us/) [sites](https://www.htx.com/support/en-us/) and one user report in the #trading channel. All withdrawals, including DCR, were suspended in response to the two [November hacks](202311.md#ecosystem) on these exchanges.

- Indian financial authorities announced the decision to [block URLs of 9 offshore exchanges](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/12/29/indias-local-crypto-and-web3-advocacy-body-asked-for-action-against-offshore-entities-source/) for not complying with local AML regulations. If the block will be implemented, accessing DCR markets on Binance, KuCoin, and other exchanges from India will become more difficult.


### Other news

- Users of hardware wallet [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) fell victim to a [supply chain attack](https://www.ledger.com/blog/security-incident-report) on December 14th. A compromised [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) account of a former Ledger employee was used by an attacker to upload a malicious version of the Ledger Connect Kit library used by many DApps, which tricked EVM DApp users into signing transactions that drain their wallets. The vulnerability was patched quickly, but it took around ~5 hours for the fix to propagate. The exploit was limited to third party DApps which use the library, it did not affect the integrity of Ledger hardware or Ledger Live. Ledger [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1737457365526470665) that around $600K worth of assets has been affected and promised to make victims whole if they [claim](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/15580506579101) refunds. To the best of our knowledge no DCR wallets were affected by the exploit.

- [Guarda](https://guarda.com/) has been [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1161) from the list of known-to-work [wallets at decred.org](https://decred.org/wallets/) after several users [complained](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/18s54fm/help_importing_a_private_key/) that DCR was not working for 3 months. Timing suggests Guarda's DCR wallet stopped working around September 2023 because they missed to upgrade to Decred [v1.8.0](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.8.0) (released June 13th, 2023) and missed the hardfork (completed [September 1st](https://dcrdata.decred.org/block/794369), 2023). A person from Guarda [confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/18s54fm/help_importing_a_private_key/kf9n3pj/) that DCR is still considered a supported asset, but they're working on "some issues post-Decred's network upgrade". Until that is fixed, Guarda users can [export the private key](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/18s54fm/help_importing_a_private_key/kfbw3f6/) and import it in another wallet like dcrwallet or Exodus.

- Crypto lending service [CoinRabbit.io](https://coinrabbit.io/) has [added](https://twitter.com/CoinRabbitLoans/status/1739750163579625829) DCR as a collateral asset.

{ _Story ideas:_

Ledger's Connect Kit library, used heavily by DeFi applications like SushiSwap, Balancer and Zapper to allow users to interact with their wallets, was hacked when a staff member's credentials were compromised and malicious code was introduced to the GitHub repository. This allowed the hacker to [steal](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/12/14/ledger-exploit-drained-484k-upended-defi-former-staffer-linked-to-malicious-code/) $484K from users who accessed their wallets during the critical 2 hour period before the red flag was raised and many of the DeFi protocols using the library paused operations amid a general [panic](https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1735308883160100996) about the safety of any Ethereum transaction made on the day of the attack.

As of Jan 1 2024 new regulations come into [effect](https://www.paulhastings.com/insights/client-alerts/digital-asset-reporting-is-here) which treat digital assets as cash in the sense that receiving more than $10,000 from a single recipient will mandate reporting the transaction event and the identity of the sender to the IRS on a Form 8300. This was a provision of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs (“Infrastructure Act”) that was passed in 2021, and it is widely seen as presenting a problematic increase in the level of admin work involved in receiving cryptocurrency as a business.

Tether has started [freezing](https://www.theblock.co/post/266872/tether-freezes-all-ofac-sanctioned-wallets-in-proactive-security-measure) the assets held by wallet addresses sanctioned by OFAC, and has also blacklisted the contract address for Tornado Cash. Tether has also been happily "[onboarding](https://www.theblock.co/post/267973/tether-weve-onboarded-fbi-secret-service-to-our-platform)" the US Secret Service and FBI to their platform, while bragging about the 435 million USDT it has so far frozen at law enforcement's behest.

Binance has been [running](https://www.ft.com/content/47fe6542-d000-4051-86d9-feb0055697da) half-day courses in France that introduce people to blockchain concepts and software like Metamask, and get them to sign up to Binance to receive their "NFT diploma", and in some of the poorer regions which they have targeted attendees are being forced to sign up for this "education" as part of a state-sponsored retraining effort. This is one of the outcomes of French PM Macron's relatively welcoming attitude towards the company which saw Binance pledge to invest 100 million euros in the country's burgeoning crypto scene in 2021, as detailed in [this article](https://www.ft.com/content/47fe6542-d000-4051-86d9-feb0055697da).







{ _Hints (all optional):_

_1. Besides dramatic "epic fails", try to also report "epic wins" in areas relevant to Decred. Balance is good and we can learn from both._

_2. Order the stories as follows:_

- _Crypto L1 tech: PoW, ASIC resistance, full nodes, network security, etc._
- _Crypto L2+ tech: "Smart" contracts, DEX projects_
- _Crypto governance, finances, transparency, funding, chain forks, community splits_
- _Relevant exchanges and websites_
- _Regulations, privacy, security_
- _Fun stuff_
