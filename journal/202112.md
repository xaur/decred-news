## v1.7 Release Candidates

{ quick info how to join testing }


## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{ hint: below add an overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warrants a paragraph. drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans }

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

_dcrd is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Development work for the upcoming "Change PoW/PoS Subsidy Split To 10/80" consensus change has been completed, including the agenda [definitions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2847), the [consensus vote](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2848) with new consensus rules and tests, and the [DCP-10](https://github.com/decred/dcps/pull/23) document with technical details. A small geek bonus of this change is it will increase the theoretical supply limit from the uncomfortable 20,999,999.99800912 to a more satisfying 21,000,000.00015952 DCR.

The new `primitives` package has been kickstarted with initial [proof-of-work](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2788) functions, calculations of [merkle tree](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2826) roots, and functions for generating and verifying [inclusion](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2827) proofs (along with full tests, benchmarks, and docs). New PoW functions build upon the new optimized `uint256` package and are much faster than the ones in use currently. `primitives` is a large refactoring [plan](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2786) to collect core consensus code in one place.

Other merged changes:

- introduced [`AssumeValid`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2839) parameter and config option to skip certain validation checks for blocks prior to the specified block (which is assumed valid). Compared to using checkpoints for same purpose, `AssumeValid` allows to skip more validation work and gives greater flexibility to node operators and developers (for testing).
- added an additional child key [derivation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2845) method that strictly conforms to the [BIP-32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) standard, to be used by DCRDEX. Decred's current method differs from the standard for legacy reasons.
- fixed logic for preventing unnecessary [reorgs](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2840)
- fixed a bug in CPU [mining](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2838) (used in simnet testing)

Maintenance, refactoring and cleanup:

- moved the `uint256` package from internal staging area and released it as v1.0.0 of the new [`math/uint256`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2842) module. The original plan was to keep it inside the `primitives` module, but this move allows to release it sooner to serve projects outside of Decred. The new location also better reflects that it is a general purpose package, unlike `primitives`, which will be focused on Decred-specific things.
- initial work to refactor [peer banning](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2554) and ban score tracking into a `banmanager` package
- changed RPC server to [submit](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2835) transactions directly now that piping it through `netsync` is no longer needed
- updated indexer [error](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2770) types to leverage Go 1.13 error handling
- updated module dependencies for the upcoming release
- created [release-v1.7](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commits/release-v1.7) branch to build release candidates and releases from

{ sanity check: [#2753](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2753) would also trigger the hard fork vote for DCP0010 right? }

<a id="dcrwallet" />

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

_dcrwallet is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet applications._

- added an optional parameter to set treasury vote [policy](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2053) specific to a treasury key or a ticket hash (will be used by VSP)
- upgraded to [`cspp/v2`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2111) module which includes an additional post-quantum key exchange
- return more useful info from address validation methods in [gRPC](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2091) and [JSON-RPC](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2096) APIs
- added gRPC method to [import](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2116) extended public key
- added gRPC method to import [voting accounts](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1945) derived from a different seed (may be used by staking with Trezor and vspd)
- added a config option to [limit](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2107) CSPP server connections per change amount
- migrated to the new [`stdscript`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2108) package from dcrd
- fixed possible issues with 1-deep [reorgs](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2110) in SPV mode
- fixed [`listreceivedbyaccount`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2119) with imported BIP-44 accounts

<a id="decrediton" />

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

_Decrediton is a full-featured desktop wallet app with integrated voting, StakeShuffle mixing, Lightning Network, DEX trading, and more. It runs with or without a full blockchain (SPV mode)._

User-facing:

- added a [filter](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3609) by tx id to Transaction History and Ticket History views
- updated [DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3608) module to pull in v0.4 features

- fixed an issue with upgrading [certificates](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3616) for some older wallets

Internal:

- reused a few more components from the pi-ui library ([highlighted text](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3606), [paginator](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3603), [toggle](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3604), [buttons](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3610) and icons)

<a id="politeia" />

**[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia)**

_Politeia is Decred's proposal system. It is used to request funding from the Decred treasury._

Politeia v1.3.1 bugfix and polishing release is live on the [proposals](https://proposals.decred.org/) website. Check the release notes in [politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia/releases/tag/v1.3.1) and [politeiagui](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/releases/tag/v1.3.1) repositories for detailed changes.

Voting on the block reward change [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/427e1d4) exposed a bug that prevented some late votes from being counted. It started on Dec 9 18:36 UTC when the highest ever voter participation rate surpassed 32,767 votes (78% turnout) and hit an unintended internal limit. In the remaining ~25 hours of voting, clients were unable to cast their votes or start new vote trickling processes with politeiavoter (trickling that had started prior to the last ~25 hours could still continue). Importantly, the bug could not have changed the vote outcome, e.g. even if 8,752 remaining eligible tickets all voted No it would still pass with 79% Yes. The fix was included and deployed with v1.3.1. See [#1605](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1605) for technical details. { consider moving to Governance since it looks like a PSA }

User-facing changes merged in December:

- removed Markdown [link button](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2678) from editor toolbar to prevent user mistakes
- fixed missing proposal published and edited [dates](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2680)
- fixed downloading of vote [timestamps](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2685)
- fixed user menu [alignment](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2682)
- fixed infinite [loading](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2674) on admin approved list

Internal GUI changes:

- added data mocking for proposal [creation](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2676) and [editing](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2692) flows, to enable automated UI testing without connecting to a backend

politeiavoter command-line app:

- improved reporting of ["already voted"](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1594) errors
- [improved UX](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1601) of `--hoursprior` and `--voteduration` settings
- fixed [stopping](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1592) the process with Ctrl-C

Backend changes:

- allow to retreive all [comment votes](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1598) without specifying the user ID filter (this was requested to better analyze the proposal process)
- added a [cache](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1586) for proposal statuses to speed up loading of approved proposals
- execute batch reads [concurrently](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1584) to improve performance
- converted route [page sizes](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1604) to plugin settings to remove duplication and make it easily configurable by a sysadmin
- ensure consistent [ordering](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1607) of returned records
- tell clients if comments extra data is allowed in the [policy](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1602) response
- fixed handling of more than 32,767 votes by loading records in [multiple](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1605) SELECT queries

<a id="cspp" />

**[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp)**

_cspp is a server for coordinating coin mixes using the CoinShuffle++ protocol. It is non-custodial, i.e. does not hold any funds._

- implemented [post-quantum](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/73) key exchange based on Streamlined [NTRU Prime](https://ntruprime.cr.yp.to/index.html) 4591^761. This key exchange occurs in addition to an x25519 key exchange as previously, such that if a weakness in [sntrup4591761](https://github.com/companyzero/sntrup4591761) is discovered, the security won't reduce to anything worse than just x25519.
- added [tags](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/76) to signed key exchange messages to prevent signature forgery
- check all signed messages for valid signatures (future-proofing if the server code is replaced with a decentralized coordination protocol)

## Governance

In December the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 10,252 DCR worth $816K at December's average rate of $79.59. 1,006 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $80K at December's rate, or $109K at November's billing rate of $108.13. As of Jan 6, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 753,934 DCR (47.8 million USD at $63.37).

The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/427e1d4) to change the block reward distribution was approved by Politeia vote with 91.7% approval and turnout of 79% - an issue on the final day's voting meant that late votes could not be submitted or counted, but the result was so one-sided this could not have affected the outcome.

A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/1a290d8) for further funding of the [@StakeShuffle_](https://twitter.com/StakeShuffle_) twitter bot was submitted. The requested sum of $1,684 would cover work done to improve the bot and hosting for 2022.

dYdX "DEX" suffers from AWS https://beincrypto.com/coinbase-binance-and-decentralized-exchanges-go-down-due-to-aws-outage/

The Sushiswap AMM DEX is the subject of a [scandal](https://rekt.news/sushiswap-scandal/) after it emerged that 0xMaki had been forced out of their role by a clique of senior developers, and that the team is riven by internal conflict. 

BadgerDAO was the subject of a [hack](https://badger.com/technical-post-mortem) involving a compromised Cloudflare API key, which was used to inject malicious code for a subset of site users, leading to the loss of $130 million in assets, with $9 million being recovered thus far and a [plea](https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7dv4a/hacked-cryptocurrency-platform-begs-hacker-to-please-return-dollar119-million) for more to be returned by the hacker. The funds were not returned, and the BadgerDAO community has moved to determining how to make [restitution](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/16/after-130m-hack-badgers-restitution-plan-tests-limits-of-dao-governance/) for victims of the hack. There is an interesting dynamic at play here where the stolen funds fall into three tranches with different remedy mechanisms - and the top 10 token holders were the most severely affected, representing a loss that the treasury cannot cover with available funds. One major victim of the BadgerDAO hack was the Celsius network, which [reportedly](https://cryptopotato.com/celsius-network-reportedly-lost-50-million-in-the-120-million-badgerdao-hack/) lost $50 million. 

Users of popular NFT trading platform OpenSea became eligible to claim a new [token](https://decrypt.co/89325/sos-token-aidrop-opendao-opensea-what-you-need-to-know-explainer) (SOS) on Dec 24, and by Dec 26 over 200,000 wallets had claimed it. The token was not produced by OpenSea themselves, who have instead hinted at an IPO, but was rather released by a pseudonymous developer, using the public record of OpenSea NFT trades to determine eligibility to claim SOS. The market cap of SOS hit $200 million within two days, as initial votes were passed to set up liquidity provision incentives and other token distribution details. The issuance plans for SOS include reserving 20% to provide support to OpenSea users, particularly hack victims.

The EOS validators have moved to [block](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/126801/eos-community-halts-payments-worth-250-million-in-eos-to-block-one-and-brock-pierce) the payment of $250 million worth of EOS to Block.one. Block.one was due to receive 67 million EOS over a 6-7 year period, with half of these tokens going to Brock Pierce. This comes as part of an ongoing dispute over EOS intellectual property, which the community of validators wish to acquire but which is currently held by the Bullish exchange (reasons unclear). 

Public goods funding platform Gitcoin [deactivated](https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1469046914226307127) a grant for one of the recipient teams because the team conducted some activities in Iran and had recently been de-funded by Consensys. Gitcoin also [completed](https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1471635072952389632) round 12 of its grants program, which saw $3.1 million donated from 27.2k donors.

"The Internet Computer" held a major round of [voting](https://medium.com/dfinity/the-internet-computers-long-term-r-d-plans-motion-proposals-guide-dce6fdcd697d) to approve future direction of research and development work, with 25 different proposals to vote on and DFINITY foundation abstaining from the vote. The voting period for these proposals was just 24 hours and all 25 were approved with 5-6% approval (minimum requirement of 3% voting power voting yes) and very little opposition.
