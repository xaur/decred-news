## v1.7 Release Testing

Release candidate builds for the upcoming v1.7 "Based Bison" release are [available for testing](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases). Make sure to [verify](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/verifying-binaries/) the downloads before running. For extra safety [testnet coins](https://devdocs.decred.org/environments/testnet/) can be used for testing until the final release is out.

All help to make the final release bug-free and polished is greatly appreciated. Please report any issues in #support chat in [Matrix](https://chat.decred.org/#/room/#support:decred.org), [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/349993843728449537/350007452152102923), [Telegram](https://t.me/DecredSupport), or directly in the appropriate [GitHub repo](https://github.com/decred). Good hunting!


## Vote on Treasury Spends

Starting with the [payment](#governance) for November work, payments to contractors will from now on be made from the new treasury following the decentralized voting process.

If you use the command-line tools to solo vote please set your preference in the following manner:

    dcrctl --wallet settreasurypolicy "03f6e7041f1cf51ee10e0a01cd2b0385ce3cd9debaabb2296f7e9dee9329da946c" "yes or no"

That command sets how your wallet votes for treasury spend transactions ("tspends") signed by that key. The key `03f6e704...` represents the current management of the treasury and the command sets your trust to it.

You can verify this key in the [DCP-0006](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0006/dcp-0006.mediawiki#chain-parameters) or in the [source code](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/79f15b7f7269f3e139e1ce6ff7bf00d787a48a73/chaincfg/mainnetparams.go#L485). The voting is semi-automated with this one-time configuration, but it is possible to vote on individual tspend transactions when more granular control is needed.

Currently, tspends can only be voted on by solo stakers, VSP support is in the pipeline to allow Decrediton users to participate.

Read the [May issue](202105.md#new-treasury-activated) on how the process works and the [Governance](#governance) section on how the first real tspend was executed in December.


## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

_dcrd is a full node implementation that powers Decred's peer-to-peer network around the world._

Development work for the upcoming "Change PoW/PoS Subsidy Split To 10/80" consensus change has been completed, including the agenda [definitions](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2847), the [consensus vote](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2848) with new consensus rules and tests, and the [DCP-10](https://github.com/decred/dcps/pull/23) document with technical details. A small geek bonus of this change is it will increase the theoretical supply limit from the uncomfortable 20,999,999.99800912 to a more satisfying 21,000,000.00015952 DCR.

The new `primitives` package has been kickstarted with initial [proof-of-work](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2788) functions, calculations of [merkle tree](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2826) roots, and functions for generating and verifying [inclusion](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2827) proofs (along with full tests, benchmarks, and docs). New PoW functions build upon the new optimized `uint256` package and are much faster than the ones in use currently. `primitives` is a large refactoring [plan](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2786) to collect core consensus code in one place.

Other merged changes:

- introduced [`AssumeValid`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2839) parameter and config option to skip certain validation checks prior to the specified block (which is assumed valid). Compared to using checkpoints for the same purpose, `AssumeValid` allows skipping more validation work and gives greater flexibility to node operators and developers (for testing).
- added an additional child key [derivation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2845) method that strictly conforms to the [BIP-32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) standard, to be used by DCRDEX. Decred's current method differs from the standard for legacy reasons.

Maintenance, refactoring, and cleanup:

- moved the `uint256` package from internal staging area and released it as v1.0.0 of the new [`math/uint256`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2842) module. The original plan was to keep it inside the `primitives` module, but this move allows to release it sooner to serve projects outside of Decred. The new location also better reflects that it is a general purpose package, unlike `primitives`, which will be focused on Decred specifics.
- initial work to refactor [peer banning](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2554) and ban score tracking into a `banmanager` package
- changed RPC server to [submit](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2835) transactions directly now that piping it through `netsync` is no longer needed
- updated module dependencies for the upcoming release

<a id="dcrwallet" />

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

_dcrwallet is a wallet server used by command-line and graphical wallet applications._

- added an optional parameter to set treasury vote [policy](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2053) specific to a treasury key or a ticket hash (will be used by VSP staking)
- return more useful info from address validation in [gRPC](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2091) and [JSON-RPC](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2096) methods
- added gRPC method to [import](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2116) extended public key
- added gRPC method to import [voting accounts](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1945) derived from a different seed (may be used by staking with Trezor and vspd)
- upgraded to [`cspp/v2`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2111) module which includes an additional post-quantum key exchange
- added a config option to [limit](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2107) CSPP server connections per change amount
- migrated to the new [`stdscript`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2108) package from dcrd
- fixed possible issues with 1-deep [reorgs](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2110) in SPV mode
- fixed [`listreceivedbyaccount`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2119) with imported BIP-44 accounts

- added data mocking for proposal [creation](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2676) and [editing](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2692) flows, to enable automated UI testing without connecting to a backend

politeiavoter command-line app:

- improved reporting of ["already voted"](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1594) errors
- [improved UX](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1601) of `--hoursprior` and `--voteduration` settings
- fixed [stopping](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1592) the process with Ctrl-C

Backend changes:

- allow retrieving all [comment votes](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1598) without specifying the user ID filter (this was requested to better analyze the proposal process)
- added a [cache](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1586) for proposal status to speed up loading of approved proposals
- execute batch reads [concurrently](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1584) to improve performance
- converted route [page sizes](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1604) to plugin settings to remove duplication and make it easily configurable by a sysadmin

**[cspp](https://github.com/decred/cspp)**

_cspp is a server for coordinating coin mixes using the CoinShuffle++ protocol. It is non-custodial, i.e. does not hold any funds._

- implemented [post-quantum](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/73) key exchange based on Streamlined [NTRU Prime](https://ntruprime.cr.yp.to/index.html) 4591^761. This key exchange occurs in addition to an x25519 key exchange as previously, such that if a weakness in [sntrup4591761](https://github.com/companyzero/sntrup4591761) is discovered, the security won't reduce to anything worse than just x25519.
- added [tags](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/76) to signed key exchange messages to prevent signature forgery
- check all signed messages for valid [signatures](https://github.com/decred/cspp/pull/78) (future-proofing the code if it will be used as part of a decentralized coordination protocol)

## Governance

In December the new [treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 10,252 DCR worth $816K at December's average rate of $79.59. 1,006 DCR was spent to pay contractors, worth $80K at December's rate, or $109K at November's billing rate of $108.13. As of Jan 6, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and [new treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) is 753,934 DCR (47.8 million USD at $63.37).

Decred's first spend from the new treasury was approved by a decentralized vote!

On Dec 18 the [transaction](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/f57f2f35abcfc58cb8d45da6315982610203c1335ee0d68b36240f22c24a557a) paying 1,006 DCR to contractors was broadcast to the network along with an [announcement](https://twitter.com.com/decredproject/status/1472050886830702597) with instructions on how to vote and verify the treasury key. The vote started on late Dec 18 and finished on Dec 28 when the transaction was mined in block [619,776](https://dcrdata.decred.org/block/619776). Out of 17,280 max eligible tickets, 6,269 had voted Yes and 0 had voted No by Dec 28, which created an insurmountable tally of Yes votes and triggered the "short-circuit" system to finish the vote 2 days sooner than the maximum 12 days. This algorithm allowed to make the decision faster and pay the contractors earlier.

Back in June, the first attempt to pay from the new treasury failed due to [a bug](202106.md#new-treasury-bug) making the safety system too aggressive and blocking the payment. That voting was still notable for [showing](202106.md#governance) an impressive 69% ticket participation and 100% support. Since then the contractors have been paid from the legacy treasury, but recently the unintended limit of 0.15 DCR has ended and it allowed to start making full payments from the new treasury. A consensus change was [developed](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0007/dcp-0007.mediawiki) to correct the behavior and prevent this scenario in the future, voting to activate it will start when enough users upgrade to the upcoming v1.7 release.

On Politeia, voting on the block reward change [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/427e1d4) exposed a bug that prevented some late votes from being counted. It started on Dec 9 18:36 UTC when the highest ever voter participation rate surpassed 32,767 votes (78% of all eligible tickets) and hit an unintended internal limit. In the remaining ~25 hours of voting, clients were unable to cast their votes or start new vote trickling processes with politeiavoter (trickling that had started prior to the last ~25 hours could still continue). Importantly, the bug could not have changed the vote outcome, e.g. even if 8,752 remaining eligible tickets all voted No it would still pass with 79% Yes. The fix was included and deployed with v1.3.1, see [#1605](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1605) for technical details. This bug only related to the Politeia vote, it does not affect the consensus vote that will be triggered by the release of v1.7.0.

Proposal activity in December:

- The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/427e1d4) to change the block reward distribution was approved by Politeia vote with 91.7% approval and turnout of 79%. It has also collected a record of 166 comments.

- A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/1a290d8) for further funding of the [@StakeShuffle_](https://twitter.com/StakeShuffle_) Twitter bot was submitted. The requested sum of $1,684 would cover work done to improve the bot and hosting for 2022.

See Politeia Digest [issue 50](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue050/) for more details on the month's proposals.


## Network

**Hashrate**: December's [hashrate](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=kwlns8ia-kxwxs928&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~430 Ph/s and closed ~380 Ph/s, bottoming at 247 Ph/s and peaking at 535 Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on Jan 2: Poolin 47%, AntPool 26%, F2Pool 10%, ViaBTC 7%, Luxor 6%, BTC.com 3%, OKEx 0.3%, CoinMine 0.1%. Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) before Jan 2 closely matched the reported numbers.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=kwlns8ia-kxwxs928&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between 191.9-233.3 DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at 214.7 DCR (+11.1).

The [locked amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=kwlns8ia-kxwxs928&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was 8.07-8.60 million DCR, meaning that 59.2-62.7% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=kwlns8ia-kxwxs928&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake. Both absolute and percentage values made new all-time highs.

![stake participation](../img/202112.2.github.png)

_What has been staked... Cannot be unstaked_

**VSP**: On Jan 2, ~6,550 (-250) live tickets were managed by [listed](https://decred.org/vsp/) vspd servers and 171 (-28) by listed legacy dcrstakepool servers. Collectively the 7 legacy and 15 new VSPs managed 16.7% (-0.8%) of the ticket pool. The 3 unlisted but still active legacy VSPs managed 39 (-6) live tickets.

The chat bridge between Telegram [@Decred](https://t.me/Decred) and Matrix #101 rooms was deactivated due to a large amount of spam. The spam was removed automatically by the moderation bots on the Telegram side but had to be manually cleaned up in the Matrix room. The bridge between Matrix and Discord #101 rooms remains.

The highly-discussed block reward change proposal made an appearance on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29530099).

## Relevant External

The Sushiswap AMM DEX is the subject of a [scandal](https://rekt.news/sushiswap-scandal/) after it emerged that 0xMaki had been forced out of their role by a clique of senior developers and that the team is riven by internal conflict.

BadgerDAO was the subject of a [hack](https://badger.com/technical-post-mortem) involving a compromised Cloudflare API key, which was used to inject malicious code for a subset of site users, leading to the loss of $130 million in assets, with $9 million being recovered thus far and a [plea](https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7dv4a/hacked-cryptocurrency-platform-begs-hacker-to-please-return-dollar119-million) for more to be returned by the hacker. The funds were not returned, and the BadgerDAO community has moved to determining how to make [restitution](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/16/after-130m-hack-badgers-restitution-plan-tests-limits-of-dao-governance/) for victims of the hack. There is an interesting dynamic at play here where the stolen funds fall into three tranches with different remedy mechanisms - and the top 10 token holders were the most severely affected, representing a loss that the treasury cannot cover with available funds. One major victim of the BadgerDAO hack was the Celsius network, which [reportedly](https://cryptopotato.com/celsius-network-reportedly-lost-50-million-in-the-120-million-badgerdao-hack/) lost $50 million.

Users of popular NFT trading platform OpenSea became eligible to claim a new [token](https://decrypt.co/89325/sos-token-aidrop-opendao-opensea-what-you-need-to-know-explainer) (SOS) on Dec 24, and by Dec 26 over 200,000 wallets had claimed it. The token was not produced by OpenSea themselves, who have instead hinted at an IPO, but was rather released by a pseudonymous developer, using the public record of OpenSea NFT trades to determine eligibility to claim SOS. The market cap of SOS hit $200 million within two days, as initial votes were passed to set up liquidity provision incentives and other token distribution details. The issuance plans for SOS include reserving 20% to provide support to OpenSea users, particularly hack victims.

The EOS validators have moved to [block](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/126801/eos-community-halts-payments-worth-250-million-in-eos-to-block-one-and-brock-pierce) the payment of $250 million worth of EOS to Block.one. Block.one was due to receive 67 million EOS over a 6-7 year period, with half of these tokens going to Brock Pierce. This comes as part of an ongoing dispute over EOS intellectual property, which the community of validators wishes to acquire but which is currently held by the Bullish exchange (reasons unclear).

Public goods funding platform Gitcoin [deactivated](https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1469046914226307127) a grant for one of the recipient teams because the team conducted some activities in Iran and had recently been de-funded by Consensys. Gitcoin also [completed](https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1471635072952389632) round 12 of its grants program, which saw $3.1 million donated from 27.2K donors.

"The Internet Computer" held a major round of [voting](https://medium.com/dfinity/the-internet-computers-long-term-r-d-plans-motion-proposals-guide-dce6fdcd697d) to approve future direction of research and development work, with 25 different proposals to vote on and DFINITY foundation abstaining from the vote. The voting period for these proposals was just 24 hours and all 25 were approved with 5-6% approval (minimum requirement of 3% voting power voting yes) and very little opposition.

That's all for December. Thanks for reading!


## The Future of Decred Journal

> 45 months of Decred Journal was a great ride but recent issues were getting increasingly harder to make due to lack of time and energy. I plan to stop producing DJ after this issue, take a break, and do other things I wanted to do in Decred and beyond.
> 
> I will be around in chats to help anyone willing to take over the production of DJ, either as it looks today, or in a refreshed form to make it better.

> Thank you to all contributors, translators, and most importantly readers, for this amazing journey! (@bee)
