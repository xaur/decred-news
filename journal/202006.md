## Decred's Rosetta Middleware Implementation

An [implementation](https://community.rosetta-api.org/t/decreds-rosetta-middleware-implementation/79) of the Rosetta API for Decred was [released](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1279127834137636866) on Jul 3.

Rosetta was [released](https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1273269255610531841) by Coinbase on Jun 17:

> Coinbase initially developed Rosetta as the middleware used to integrate blockchains into its platform securely and painlessly (...)
> 
> For developers of new blockchain projects, the Rosetta interface makes it easier to ensure compatibility with exchanges that use Rosetta, and can dramatically speed up the time it takes exchanges to integrate with new blockchains and protect customer funds by ensuring specific security conditions are met.
> 
> For the broader community of crypto developers, Rosetta makes it easier to build cross-blockchain applications such as block explorers, wallets and dapps. Instead of writing custom parsing for every supported blockchain, applications can use a blockchain project's Rosetta implementation to read on-chain data and construct transactions in a standard format; minimizing code and simplifying maintenance.

Rosetta features interesting design [principles](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/principles_introduction.html), [no gatekeepers](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/no_gatekeepers.html) policy, strict security requirements for [wallet](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/wallet_api_introduction.html) implementations, [staking](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/staking_contract_support.html) support, and a [test suite](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-cli) to validate implementations. The first released [SDK](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/rosetta_sdk_go.html) is for the Go language as it is heavily [used](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-specifications#user-content-sdks-in-more-languages) at Coinbase.

## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

- extracted [interfaces](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2211) in `rpcserver` to allow mocking and added tests for some of its handlers
- fixed [mempool](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2232) view construction when dealing with disapproved blocks (resolves some issues around transactions on testnet being rejected by the mempool that really shouldn't have been in certain conditions)
- fixed edge case crashes of the RPC server with crafted JSON ([one](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2218), [another](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2221))
- [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2222) Encrypt and Decrypt functions to discourage their use and instead recommend to use modern encryption scheme (e.g. [AEAD ciphers](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/27248))

In progress:

- [asynchronous](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2219) indexing

The majority of the efforts in dcrd for June went into the decentralized Treasury work. The [pull request](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2170) is undergoing the review process and adding tests to ensure correctness, but it appears to be feature complete. Once it is finished, a [Decred Change Proposal](https://github.com/decred/dcps) will follow.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

- added [methods](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1705) to fetch filters and blocks unrelated to wallet data, which is useful for external callers such as dcrlnd { @matheusd anything to add? }
- avoid [uncommon](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1751) CoinJoin amounts { how to explain this in a simple way? }
- [cap](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1759) the amount of outputs produced by downmixing { this too }
- bug fixes

- next part of [CSPP integration](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2475) implementing safety restrictions for mixed accounts
- unified the [processing](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2468) of regular and stake transactions { how to explain it better? }
- allow [multiple](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2491) outstanding LN payments { anything to add? }
- new component for [eligible](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2510) tickets
- a view showing configured [VSPs](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2482)
- more code [converted](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2537) to use functional components and CSS modules

- UI tweaks and bug fixes

In progress:

- PoC [integration](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2516) of the new vspd

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia):

- better [caching](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1226) of vote results
- [lazy loading](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1219) of comment votes to benefit from the fact that old proposals are rarely accessed
- increased [test coverage](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1203) of the new RFP code
- permanent [logout](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1903) feature that deletes user identity and drafts from the browser, this change also removes the use of email as a storage key to have less personal data in browser's local storage
- allow [short URLs](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1962) on the UI
- improved [diff viewer](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1988) for proposal versions
- [prevent](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1966) comments and proposal submission when anchoring
- CMS: viewer for past [versions](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1980) of an invoice
- CMS: passthrough requests for [proposal data](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1171) to avoid cross-site requests that cause security issues
- lots of backend and UI bug fixes

In progress:

- TOTP 2FA support
- ability for CMS admins to review [spending](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2032) of approved proposals

The [tlog implementation](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1180) in the base politeiad backend is complete. Work on adding the plugins to it is ongoing. Plugin functionality includes comments, comment likes, and proposal votes. Next step will be to load the tlog implementation with existing mainnet data and run performance tests against it before launching. It's possible that some things might need to be reworked if any issues are discovered.

[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd):

- [tolerate](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/104) dcrwallet connection failures
- reject [unvotable](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/93) tickets
- initial [deployment](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/95) guide

- initial [admin page](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/119)
- [refreshed](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/138) UI look
- multiple changes to improve input validation, error handling, shutdown, etc

The core functionality is complete and developers are in the process of thoroughly testing and shaking out edge cases with mixed/unmixed tickets, with/without the auto-ticket buyer. vspd has been used to vote on tens of thousands of testnet tickets at this point.

[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool):

- v1.1.0 [RC2](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/releases/tag/v1.1.0-rc2) and [RC3](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/releases/tag/v1.1.0-rc3) released fixing a few bugs since RC1

- conversion of asset backends to [plugins](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/362)

Addressing concerns about the project timeline, @chappjc noted:

> Mainnet beta will be this summer. Dev [plan](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/417607aaedff2942ff3701cdb4eff76637eca4ed7f7ba816e5c0bd2e971602e1) is to do that by end of Q2 2020, and we are. Also, the client browser interface was barely hinted at in the dev proposal and we dramatically expanded the scope of the project to make it happen and look good. LTC and generic BTC-clone support wasn't part of the prop, but we got that done too. We also conceived a new epoch matching algorithm based on cryptographic commitments from the clients, the preimages for which are revealed at epoch close, and completely reimplemented it halfway through the project. Not easy or quick, but it's done too and it's a big improvement over the original spec. ([2020-06-01](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$15910318461825cyXfI:decred.org))

The team is working on the remaining UX issues and preparing for a limited mainnet deployment in a couple of weeks.

[dcrandroid](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrandroid):

- repository moved to the planetdecred organization
- implemented [Espresso](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrandroid/pull/481) tests and migrated from Travis CI to GitHub Actions

[dcrios](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrios):

- repository moved to the planetdecred organization
- [Chinese](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrios/pull/695) translation
- various UI [fixes](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrios/pull/694)

[godcr](https://github.com/planetdecred/godcr):

godcr is an emerging cross-platform desktop SPV wallet for Decred built with [Gio](https://gioui.org/), an immediate mode GUI toolkit written in Go. This makes the whole application built purely with Go with no web browser or javascript in it, and a much smaller dependency graph (and audit surface) - an important property for software that controls money. As of writing, the compiled binary is ~30 MB.

The project started in Jan 2020 but before settling on Gio, since Sep 2018 the developers have built multiple GUI prototypes (terminal, in-browser, Nucular, Fyne) which are now archived in the [godcr-old](https://github.com/raedahgroup/godcr-old) repository.

{ status, plans? }

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata):

{ anything notable? }

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs):

- [LN Data Backup](https://docs.decred.org/lightning-network/backups/) page [added](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1106), a must-read for those testing Decred LN to prevent fund loss
- [Contributing](https://docs.decred.org/contributing/overview/) page now lists a few personal [stories](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1101) of becoming a contractor

## Governance

In June the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 12,629 DCR and spent 8,340 DCR. Using June's daily average DCR/USD rate of $16.05, this is $203K received and $134K spent. At May's average daily rate of $14.11, the USD figure billed for work completed in that month is $118K. As of Jul 1, Treasury balance is 633,820 DCR (9.08 million USD at $14.32).

Six proposals were voted on in June, with 4 approved and 2 rejected, with relatively high turnout for these proposals as compared to some recent proposals that. The proposals to be approved were:

* Decred OnChain - A Research and Charting Resource - 86% approval (38% turnout)
* Decred Latam Marketing and Events Proposal 2 - 61% approval (41% turnout)
* DCR On-Chain Research: Phase 2 - 74% approval (31% turnout)
* Decred Bug Bounty Program: Phase 3 - 98% approval (32% turnout)

The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4affceb07f5b8126366e8b73ed3d164ebc010bc6fefba19375c4c2e2b252beb0) to sponsor a book (CoinStory) for $500 was rejected with 11.6% approval and 34% turnout, while the TV marketing [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/9eaafc20f206776e38642e272233390f351c5562c3835369a558cc7d7e341018) had 8% approval and 29% turnout.

Politeia Digest issue [#32](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue032/) has further details on all of the above.

A new [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/df11d7ac85061e6a02d6503555e585a1a37fffd82101eeea14670537c951926f) from @ivandecredfan for Russian content production was published in Jun and started voting in July. @ivandecredfan submitted a similar [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/92e3f2176b332c1aea5887acd2324c2cd730ec450e563df52ddae9d5927d5d36) in Feb which was rejected with 21% approval, but stuck with his video production and took some feedback from commenters on the first proposal on board.

A proposal has been submitted which suggests choosing a new name for the project ("Bitcoin Evolution"). The Politeia admins indicated that the proposal owner (@decredinator) should add a budget and implementation plan before the proposal would be considered valid for publication on the proposals site. @decredinator [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hh2ult/a_better_name_for_decred_to_broaden_the_reach_of/) the proposal to reddit so that the community can read it and contribute to making it a reality. Most of the comments are not keen on the idea. @decredinator has also been [called out](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hh2ult/a_better_name_for_decred_to_broaden_the_reach_of/fwbfmst/ ) for spamming the link to this post across a range of unrelated tweets.

Hashrate: [June's hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=kavllavw-kc326nyn&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~390 Ph/s and closed ~512 Ph/s, bottoming at 280 Ph/s and peaking at 569 Ph/s throughout the month. Pool [hashrate distribution](https://dcrstats.com/pow) as of July 1 (approximate): UUPool 36.1%, Poolin 31.91%, lab.antpool.com 11.3%, BTC.com 3.4%, Luxor 1.07%, F2Pool 0.86%,   BeePool 0.09%, CoinMine 0.04%, Suprnova 0.02% and others ~15.2%.

Staking: [30-day average](https://dcrstats.com/) ticket price was 139.4 DCR (-2.08). The [price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=kavm0jcl-kc32b0xp&bin=window&axis=time&visibility=true-false) varied between 135.1-149.8 DCR. [Locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=kavhe9cg-kc2y3tat&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was 5.69-5.86 million DCR, which corresponded to 48.6-50.6% of the available supply [participating](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=kav7uzuu-kc2okjt7&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in PoS.

{recap of ticket price action if it was interesting}

{ hint: consider keeping Block size and Transactions sections every 2nd or 3rd month, unless there is something interesting to report }

Block size: This month, the blockchain size grew by {n} MB. [Block size](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=block-size&bin=block&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} varied between {n.n}-{n.n} with an average of {n.n} KB. {any interesting fact about this month's blocks}

Transactions: In June, Decred users made {n} regular transactions and bought {n} tickets. {n} tickets were rewarded for voting and {n} were revoked. On average, there were {n} regular DCR transactions and {n} new tickets per day.

An unusual spike of block size usage (unrelated to large Treasury payout transactions) occurred on May 29-31. Dozens of nearly full [blocks](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/blocks?height=453840&rows=50) were mined with 90-100 KB transactions which consolidated lots of tiny outputs into 6 DCR outputs. On May 31 the blockchain grew by a [record](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=block-size&bin=day&axis=time) 13 MB, compared to an average growth of 4 MB/day. It [looks like](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$15913552414776FisdN:decred.org) a VSP was consolidating ticket fees. Many of the 6 DCR outputs were later [merged](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/tx/ef562befa1f8eeee6250d98b6ccb1722b8fba508dd4919d5b85139df9c761e0c) into a pile {rr: a pile of credits? do they stack? lol} of ~240K DCR (~3.4M USD, ~2% supply), known to be associated with a popular cryptocurrency exchange. tl;dr a VSP operator sent about 200 DCR (voting fees paid by users of the VSP) to an exchange, it used a lot of block space because it involved thousands of tiny fee payments associated with individual tickets processed by that VSP.

{ hint: for dcr.farm set the zoom to show exactly UTC month 1st 00:00:00 - next month 1st 00:00:00 }

Nodes: Throughout [June](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=1590962400000&to=1593554399000) there was an average of 126 public listening nodes and 196 total nodes per dcr.farm.

- 465K of the 840K [founders premine](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/premine/#bring-up-costs) remains untouched
- 290K of the 840K [airdrop](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/premine/#airdrop) coins did not move as well
- ~27% of the 345K DCR paid by the Treasury to contractors was not touched since the contractor received it, ~24% was staked, ~24% ended up in a known exchange address, ~1.7% was mixed
- out of ~5.8M DCR PoW rewards, 60% ended up on addresses associated with exchanges, 10% has been staked, and the rest is unspent (6%) or has unknown outcome (24%).

## Integrations

{ hint: new pieces of infrastructure or updates from existing: VSPs, exchanges, wallets, OTC desks, payment processors. use bullets or paragraphs, whatever looks best in a given month's compilation }

- Hotbit [announced](https://medium.com/@hotbit/hotbits-announcement-regarding-the-launch-of-dcr-investment-product-and-current-deposit-221400da20dd) a Decred investment product on Jun 11, with an annualized return of 4.27% and "redemption period being (T+30)". There is a minimum purchase of 100 DCR and it seems like the "minimum unit for the calculation of interests of current deposit investment plan will be 1DCR", whatever that means.

- DecredVoting VSP [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hbofz4/tired_of_keeping_track_of_your_staking_activities/) a new tickets analytics dashboard which shows the VSPs users stats about their tickets, including some specific to split tickets devised by @decreddave himself which are not available elsewhere. 
- Following Kucoin's [launch](https://www.kucoin.com/news/en-decred-soft-staking-official-rules) of a custodial staking service in March 2020, @richardred has investigated staking activity associated with Kucoin-related addresses. Observations suggest that up until the end of Jun 2020 Kucoin has bought 213 tickets, and 185 of them have voted. The earliest tickets bought by addresses thought to be controlled by Kucoin were bought in December 2019, several months before the service was announced in Feb and customers were automatically opted in within 48 hours of that announcement. All of these tickets have abstained in the on chain agenda voting, and none of them have voted on Politeia proposals - Kucoin are not participating in decision-making with their tickets. According to reports user DCR balances appear to have earned ~0.45% additional DCR from this staking, considering about one quarter has passed this would put it on course for an annual rate of about ~1.8%, which is considerably lower than the rate which is projected for sovereign staking by dcrdata.

> The only thing holding Decred back in my honest opinion is more people coming up with creative ways to shout about it. It is all this thing needs. Because once you get the level of attention, the fundamentals just speak for themselves.

Decred videos are now also posted [on BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/channel/decred/) as a fallback in case anything happens to the YouTube channel. This is good timing since as expected earlier, YouTube [removed](https://cointelegraph.com/news/youtubes-algorithm-is-punishing-crypto-content-and-no-one-knows-why) a bunch of crypto videos during the COVID-19 wrongthink cleanup.

- @g687 [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hghw3a/why_people_do_not_care_about_decred/) analysis of how many times the names of a different project are mentioned by comments in a variety of subreddits, remarking that Decred was mentioned relatively little on subreddits other than /r/decred. This provoked 32 comments in response, including a high scoring [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hghw3a/why_people_do_not_care_about_decred/fw4u90p) from @jy-p which set out some possible reasons for a lack of mentions. It was also pointed out that the other projects included in the comparison had much larger market caps.

There has been some controversy about a [bug](https://medium.com/blockstream/patching-the-liquid-timelock-issue-b4b2f5f9a973) with Blockstream's Liquid service whereby the "emergency backup keys" held by Blockstream were repeatedly taking custody of funds in a way that should only have happened in an emergency. The controversey is largely around how the disclosure of the bug has been handled, with James Prestwich (who discovered it) not [impressed](https://twitter.com/_prestwich/status/1277090512126660608) by the way its severity has been downplayed by Blockstream. This [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/hhwwcb/vulnerability_discovered_in_liquid_allowing/fwdqbxc) on /r/cryptocurrency has a good timeline, including an observation that the story was not being covered on /r/bitcoin.

Reddit have opened a [call](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/) for ideas about how they might scale the recently launched points system (currently running on Ethereum's Rinkeby testnet) to the whole platform.

The cost of transactions on Ethereum has [increased by 500%](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-developers-consider-new-fee-model-as-gas-costs-climb) since April and developers are looking at ways to bring this down, including an EIP (1559) which would see users pay a "base fee" to the network plus a tip to miners when making transactions.

One Ethereum user has been paying [particularly](https://www.coindesk.com/whale-sent-130-ether-transaction-fee) high fees this month, with two separate transactions each paying $2.6 million worth of ETH as a transaction fee to miners, for a transfer of a small amount of ETH (~$100). Speculation about the cause of the high fees included mistakes and [blackmail](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1271463564440678401?s=20) attempts. Adding to the mystery, the pool which mined one of the transactions appeared to [offer](https://twitter.com/sparkpool_eth/status/1270688700968480768) to return some of the fee, but nobody came forward. 

Zcash expenses Q4 2019 https://twitter.com/coveryfire7777/status/1276575095809617922 {rr: I think we covered their expenses and transparency report once before, hard to know where to draw the line on these as there are now quite a few projects which produce them and ZEC are doing one per quarter... imo the first one is more noteworthy, then subsequent reports tend to report slightly more or less of whatever was in the first report}

{ USDT surpassed $10B }

{DEX}

A [bug](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bancors-bug-exposes-dangerously-common-practice-in-ethereum-defi) with the Bancor smart contracts was detected which would have allowed attackers to drain the funds of anyone who interacted with it, so "Bancor acted preemptively to 'steal' user funds before malicious parties could intervene". The severity of the problem was compounded by the use of "infinite approvals", which save on transaction fees and offer a better UX, but expose users to much more risk (in this case the potential attacker could get all of the depositor's tokens, not just the amount they chose to deposit). Use of infinite approvals is common to many DeFi apps.

- Bancor "smart contracts" https://cointelegraph.com/news/bancors-bug-exposes-dangerously-common-practice-in-ethereum-defi { pretty horrifying practice that again shows that very rich smart contracts is playing with fire, but is it relevant enough for Decred/DEX enough? rr: I think this is totally relevant, DeFi complexity and the messes it causes are relevant to Decred because there are people who want to do it with DCR!}

{relevant exchanges and websites}

Chainalysis [announced](https://cointelegraph.com/news/chainalysis-can-now-track-your-privacy-coins-zcash-dash) the support of Zcash and Dash privacy coins in their products.

This comes after the May's news of several exchanges [delisting](https://cointelegraph.com/news/another-exchange-delists-monero-amidst-ongoing-sex-scandal) Monero because it is better at protecting users' privacy, and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University claiming they can trace 99%+ Zcash and 30% Monero transactions{need a source for the last bit}.
