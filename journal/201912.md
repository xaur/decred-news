{sig check reminder}

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

Checkpoint logic [simplified](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2014) to pave the way to support checkpoints based on headers alone. { SB: can we put in context of latest consensus changes (assuming related to that)? }. Checkpoints are now also configurable by the caller. Orphan handling decoupled and [moved](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2008) from blockchain to block manager. In the bigger picture, these changes will help to decouple the connection code from the download logic, as required for [multi-peer](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1145) parallel downloading.

Memory usage of conditional execution logic in txscript [optimized](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2011) by replacing the condition stack with two integers.

Support for bech32 enhanced with convenience functions [added](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2025) and 
[ensuring](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2024) the human-readable part is lowercase to comply with BIP173. 

Memory leak [fixed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2027) that was specially relevant for setups that involve wallets with very large number of addresses.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): Bug fixes, dependency updates.

createrawtransaction JSON-RPC method [implemented](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1623) directly in dcrwallet so it may be called in SPV syncing mode or when the wallet is not syncing. It was previously only implemented in dcrd and was usable from dcrwallet in RPC syncing mode.

txsizes package was [exported](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1573) for reuse by dcrdex and dcrdata.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): Bug fixes, dependency upgrades.

Numerous bugs squashed, including a bug in [Trezor wallet](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2362) that could be triggered if the Trezor wallet received funds from a non-dcrwallet sender that did not set the Sequence field of the authored transaction to MaxTxInSequenceNum.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): Backend work to support CMS, bug fixes. Initial work to redesign CMS [merged](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1605). { more info welcome } { how politeiagui 1605 is different from 1625? }

[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool): Added payment request [processing](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/140) { dnldd, how does it work? do accounts request payments manually? }, added extensive [test coverage](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/141) for most components.

[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd):

Map of the Decred LN on mainnet is [live](https://ln-map.jamieholdstock.com/) { SB: ready to make public? }. Note that while LN has been integrated into Decrediton, it should still be considered as in alpha form. If looking to use LN on mainnet, it is recommended to start on testnet, make sure you're comfortable with operations you want to do on mainnet, and not use large amounts.

Port selection [modified](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/62) to make integration tests more robust. Docker build [added](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/67) to Github actions.[Removed namespacing](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/68), attention to run upstream code, because some default settings are different. Work continues on [Docker examples](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/66) to automate simnet environments with all you need to run a LN cluster.

[dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex):

New components implemented:

- [BTC exchange wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/72)
- [client orderbook backend](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/79)
- [MarketTunnel](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/85) { what does MarketTunnel do? }

Other changes:

- [order commitments](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/83) added to spec
- order timestamp resolution changed from seconds to [milliseconds](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/96)
- completed switch to [coin ID](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/91)

[dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid):

Major redesign to the user interface to implement [multi-wallet support](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/pull/401) (running more than one wallet concurrently) finally merged after many months of work. This required rewriting most of the Java code in Kotlin. All wallets are opened at startup using the same public passphrase. On the backend, multi-wallet support was [added](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrlibwallet/pull/57) to dcrlibwallet, which uses a copy of dcrwallet's SPV module to sync all wallets in one process.

Other UI improvements include showing progress bar and estimated time remaining when [rescanning](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/pull/414) and the QR code scanner gaining the ability to detect [payment amounts](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/pull/411).

This month also saw significant security enhancements. Users can now unlock the app with their [fingerprint](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/pull/413), and address validation was [moved](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/pull/421) to security tools.

[dcrios](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios):

UI enhancements continue with updated [colors](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/pull/556) and [improved](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/pull/555) menu rendering. 

Work continues on [multi-wallet](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/pull/558) support, revamped UI for [send](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/pull/557) and [receive](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/pull/553) views.

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): Merged CSPP initial [mix detection](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1610), bug fixes and code maintenance.

[tinydecred](https://github.com/decred/tinydecred):

- added display of current agendas and a menu to set [vote choice](https://github.com/decred/tinydecred/pull/25)
- automated code formatting with [Black](https://github.com/decred/tinydecred/pull/27)
- bug fixes and test improvements

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs):

Docs [updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1005) for v1.5 release. Warning about scam airdrops [added](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1035). [Forking terms](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/1018) added to Glossary.

## Governance

In December the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 14,406 DCR and spent 10,106 DCR. Using December's daily average DCR/USD rate of $18.32, this is $264K received and $185K spent. At November's average daily rate of $19.97, the USD figure billed for work completed in that month is $202K. As of Jan 1, Treasury balance is 643,836 DCR (10.9 million USD at $16.87).

December was an unusually quiet month for Politeia, with no new proposals submitted. Two proposals from Nov were voted on in Dec. The [TinyDecred budget](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/ad0f9688b3467734e2581604914b2cc32c6eb7991dff460eff41d21f66d88451) proposal was approved with 85% approval and voter participation of 32.6%. The [PlusBit POS App](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/e559188b0febcab29c49c1f7dd5c66645e31be00894a150ef7d0b8ceb6486605) was rejected with 39% approval and participation of 30.6%.

Following analysis of the public orderbooks which raised questions about the level of liquidity provision, i2 Trading have provided full trading history logs that will allow for their performance to be scrutinized in detail. Company 0 are working on a set of tools for auditing i2's performance in relation to the criteria specified in their proposal.

Politeia Digest has been taking a break while the level of politeia activity is low, it will return when new proposals are submitted.

## Outreach

Outreach in December features RC 1.5.0, which featured Dave Collins educating about consensus changes on both [Decred Assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQuY0kOt7g) and [Decred in Depth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1527JwkDrs). The additional [Decred in Depth episode featured Matheus Degiovani on Lightning Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZeqrQpf-aU). The copy for the new website was put into GitHub and submitted to the Web_Ops team in Matrix for assembly. The new site is expected to publish in January.

Much of the rest of the month focused on reflection, discussion, and planning for 2020. [@bee published his thoughts here](), which prompted vigorous discussion in #Proposals, as Ditto and Dustorf look to prepare their next proposals. Dustorf followed up with [a survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-9JRDSMFS7/) soliticing community input on priorities regarding geographies, market segments, and possible applications. He will also publish a summary of marketing expenditures prior to his next proposal. 

Ditto is collecting ideas for their 3rd PR proposal https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$157609160161317ZZSti:decred.org

## Events

Attended:

- Nov 6 - [Bitcoin & Blockchains Meetup](https://www.facebook.com/events/1444182132424731/) - Oaxaca, Mexico. @evok3d represented Decred. ([photos](https://twitter.com/ev0k3d/status/1192945388329807874), _missed in Nov_)
- Dec 4 - [Decred Demo](https://www.meetup.com/blockchaincentre/events/266659342/) - Melbourne, Australia. @eSizeDave and @zohand were invited to present Decred at Blockchain Centre's newly introduced Talk & Trade format. The demo of Politeia and Decrediton was expected to take 30 minutes but the total time surpassed 1.5 hours, which allowed to talk about key aspects of Decred and have a debate among the ~20 participants. ([report](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/blob/master/reports/20191204-blockchain-centre-talk-and-trade-melbourne-australia.md))

## Markets

In December DCR was trading between USD {n.nn}-{n.nn} / BTC {}-{}. The average daily rate was ${n.nn}.

{markets overview: USD and BTC prices, highs and lows, interesting events, interesting analysis}

## Relevant External

{PoW, ASIC resistance, full nodes, cc network security and other cc tech}

VTC [suffered](https://cryptobriefing.com/vertcoin-51-attacked-once-again/) another 51% attack and a 600 block reorg, but this time it appears that the attackers probably failed to profit from the attack as Bittrex (the likely target) disabled trading as soon as it was detected.

{governance, funding, chain forks, community forks, controversy}

The Wharton Cryptogovernance Workshop [launched](https://twitter.com/ProfPieters/status/1205219084528431113) cryptogov.net, which includes "[Governance Assessments](https://cryptogov.net/view-responses-by-question/)", self-assessed answers to a standard set of questions about blockchain governance, compiled by members of the different projects. Decred was one of 3 projects to have its [answers](https://cryptogov.net/participating-projects/entry/14/) uploaded ahead of the launch. @Akin attended an [event](https://twitter.com/kwerb/status/1146505123876802564) at Wharton in Jul 2019 where the project was instigated, and also took the lead on preparing Decred's answers, with some assistance from @richardred.

The results of the Zcash community sentiment polling were [released](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/community-sentiment-collection-results/), reporting results from the community advisory panel, forum users, and the lack of any input from PoW miners who did not signal support for any proposals. Voters could signal support for all 13 proposals by voting Yes/No on each one.

There was very little support for proposals that did not continue to dedicate 20% of the block reward to development funding.

48 of the 62 Community Advisory Panel members responded to the poll. Options #12 (60% split between EFF/Zfnd, 40% to a major grants program with extra advisors) and #10 (The "grand compromise", similar distribution to #12) did well with close to 75% support. Option #13 ("Keep it simple", 50% split ECC/Zfnd) also got >50% approval.

77 forum users (of 104 eligible) voted on the proposals (accounts created after March 2019 were not eligible). #12 did the best among this group with 70% approval, #13 also did well with over 50% support.

1% of all the circulating ZEC [voted](https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1200917828011876352?s=20) in the unofficial stake-weighted poll, the most popular options within this constituency were #10 and #8 (just 2 more years of 20% funding for ECC).

The Zcash Foundation decided to develop option #12 with some improvements, then rolled [back](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/proposed-nu4-zip/) on most of the improvements in response to pushback. The final slightly amended version of the proposal will be put to another community panel and forum user vote to confirm it.

[ZIP 1012](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zips/blob/master/zip-1012.rst), as it has become, involves extending the block reward for 4 years at 20%, with 35% going to ECC, 25% to Zfnd, and 40% for additional "Major Grants". Changes to the proposal involve making it more directly controlled by Zfnd, and removing a restriction that would have excluded ECC from receiving any funding as part of "major grants". Another change added to the proposal by Zfnd is to "Call for, and incentivize, development of decentralized voting and governance."

The Zcash Foundation also [donated](https://www.coindesk.com/zcash-foundation-funds-app-mixing-private-messaging-and-payments) $40,000 to Open Privacy for development of [Cwtch](https://openprivacy.ca/work/cwtch/), a decentralized messaging and payments platform.

IOTA got itself in a tangle and was [halted](https://cryptobriefing.com/iota-halts-15-hours-from-coordinator-bug/) for 15 hours due to a bug with the Coordinator. 

Jack Dorsey of Twitter [announced](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106) that Twitter would fund research into a decentralized version of its platform. 

Moocowmoo, a Dash Core advisor and provider of a custodial master node shares service, [disappeared](https://bitcoinist.com/making-a-dash-for-it-moocowmoo-disappears/) while in the process of winding down the service, leaving some clients waiting for their DASH back for an extended period. After the increase in attention, moocowmoo re-surfaced and the DASH [began](https://bitcoinist.com/dash-investors-funds-returned-moocowmoo-awakes/) to flow back to its rightful owners within a week.

Bitfinex [announced](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/48976/bitfinex-to-support-deposits-and-withdrawals-on-lightning-network) that it would begin supporting Lightning Network deposits and withdrawals on Dec 3.

Etherscan.io, a popular Ethereum block explorer, was [blocked](https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-internet-firewall-has-blocked-access-to-ethereum-block-explorer-etherscan-io) by the Chinese Great Firewall. No reasons were given, other block explorers remain accessible.

Google [banned](https://news.bitcoin.com/google-bans-crypto-app-metamask-from-play-store/) Metamask, a browser app for interacting with Dapps, from its play store, for allegedly doing covert mining. While their appeal was initially [rejected](https://twitter.com/metamask_io/status/1210299207820570624), the ban was [overturned](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2020/01/03/google-lifts-ban-ethereum-wallet-app-metamask-mining-cryptocurrency/) a few days later.

Google also purged a lot of crypto related videos, before reinstating them after deciding it was an [error](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50924494). The incident apparently left many affected youtube content producers [looking](https://news.bitcoin.com/youtube-christmas-purge-has-content-creators-pointing-to-these-alternate-platforms/) at the decentralized alternatives. 

A Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering [Report](https://ciphertrace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CipherTrace-Cryptocurrency-Anti-Money-Laundering-Report-2019-Q3.pdf) from CipherTrace mentioned Decred as a cryptocurrency with privacy features.

The Stellar airdrop on Keybase has been [ended](https://keybase.io/a/i/r/d/r/o/p/spacedrop2019) prematurely due to a sharp increase in junk sign-ups, with 100,000 accounts being excluded and the final allocation of Lumens being divided between 282,000 users.

The /r/ethtrader donuts experiment continued with the [launch](https://new.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/eckj24/ethtrader_special_membership_is_now_live/) of a special membership where members can pay a monthly subscription of 5,000 donuts to unlock features like name badges and the privilege to post gifs in comments.

The Maker Foundation [sold](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/51059/makerdao-receives-27-5m-from-dragonfly-and-paradigm-to-expand-into-asia) 5.5% of the total MKR supply to Dragonfly Capital and Paradigm for $27.5 million in a bespoke arrangement that will see MKR put more emphasis on the Asian market.

Months after launching a custodial staking service for Tezos, the Coinbase is now exchange is [now](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1207818862768480256) the #1 baker on the XTZ network.

"MetaCartel", an effort to create a for-profit investment DAO in the mould of the original and infamous DAO but built on the complexity-averse Moloch, released a [white paper](https://github.com/metacartel/MCV/blob/master/Whitepaper.pdf). Moloch DAO [announced](https://twitter.com/ameensol/status/1212475508262363137) an update to v2 which facilitates pairing Moloch with a legal entity without violating securities regulations.

Algorand relay nodes voted to [accept](https://algorand.foundation/long-term-vesting-plan-vote-result) an [amendment](https://algorandfoundation.cdn.prismic.io/algorandfoundation/eb2a8c69-2262-42f8-99a4-09df485207b5_EIP-11252019AF_+Conditional+Accelerated+Vesting+Nov+30.pdf) to the vesting schedule of the tokens they received as grants from the Algorand Foundation. This amendment increases the number of Algo tokens relay nodes will receive by 25%, but extends the vesting schedule from 2 to 5 years, with a mechanism to speed it up if the Algo price rises. This concludes an [episode](https://algorand.foundation/voting-procedure-eip09092019pc) which started and was missed in Sep, with relay nodes voting to suspend their own rewards until a change to the vesting schedule could be agreed.

There are around 81 Algorand relay nodes and these proposals were approved with yes votes from around 55 nodes. The Algorand nodes have completed KYC/AML checks and entered into a legal agreement with the foundation, such that part of the voting process for these proposals involved using DocuSign to sign and return copies of the amendment to the Foundation. KYC/AML checks are also [mandatory](https://algorand.foundation/200millionalgo-staking-rewards-kyc-extended) for Algo holders who wish to participate in staking and receive rewards.

Reading finance coverage in past issues you might have wondered why everybody is not talking about financial instability? One of the reasons is _distraction_, and a data point supporting it: https://www.studyfinds.org/survey-the-average-adult-will-watch-more-than-78000-hours-of-tv/
