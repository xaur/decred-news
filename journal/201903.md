}

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): Huge [refactoring](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1656) makes initial full sync [20-25%](https://twitter.com/davecgh/status/1110649183185317889) faster, down to around 45 mins on typical hardware. Another benefit is reduced vote propagation latency:

> \[latency is affected by\] many factors, but per node average from ~70ms to sub 5ms on my nodes. Need more data for better values. Good alone, but real gains will come with majority network upgrade since savings are multiplied by number of nodes votes traverse (log_8(tot)). Full deployment ~90% overall improvement. ([@davecgh](https://twitter.com/davecgh/status/1110721000172384256))

As part of the optimization `txscript` module was completely refactored to use a new zero-allocation script tokenizer.

> Initial sync is a big factor of course, but the real gains are in the ongoing transaction processing for mempool. The other really nice facet is the exported tokenizer which means it's possible to do zero-allocation analysis on scripts outside of txscript which is great for building apps (e.g. atomic swaps, taproot, etc) on top. ([@davecgh](https://matrix.to/#/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$155249146926580yNJqU:decred.org))

Because a critical and error prone area of consensus code was changed, significant effort has been put into making these changes easier to reason about and review by carefully crafting a series of 122 individual commits such that every commit message thoroughly describes its purpose, maintains consensus, and therefore passes all tests.

Bonus: the refactoring slashed some 2K lines of code. Less code, less bugs!

There is an opportunity to remove another 10-15 min of initial block download but it requires months of solid work _(hint to contributors)_.

Other merged work:

* Initial Bech32 ([BIP 173](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki)) support [ported](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1646) from btcsuite.
* Introduced reusable [LRU cache](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1683) module.
* Module `hdkeychain` [refactored](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1696) to make code less brittle and more testable.
* [Added](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1424) new background block template generators.
* Lots of refactoring and testing improvements to harden the codebase against unintended changes.

A total of [209 commits](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/compare/4e7f080b7b2cb11a8680d54dc5fb9ce735119d15...8f5019e083e92f31b2799f9d23809e0c0692d465) from 9 contributors were merged in March.

In progress:

* Another large refactor [started](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1698) to address multiple issues in `chaincfg` module.
* Discussion [started](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1645) to protect node seeding process from DNS based attacks.

In the big picture, changes like background block template generator and part of `txscript` optimization aim to improve scalability and reduce the number of missed votes on the network through improvements to the mining infrastructure and reduction of voting propagation latencies. The other part of `txscript` and `chaincfg` refactoring are infrastructure work to properly introduce a new script engine version for future desirable consensus changes such as the decentralized treasury spending. Even if that proposal doesn't pass, the infrastructure is still needed for a wide variety of future script-related consensus changes.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): bug fixes and code maintenance. Merged [12 commits](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/9f5f1163d8bf8037138f07734002470d4100de21...9450c9183e71231065dc0ea25087a47e8e5bb38e) from 6 contributors.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): Ticket activity heatmap visualization merged among smaller fixes - total [5 commits](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/35ab6e216dde0bc90d76334e25eb5174bf62e623...f80e832e55231a8f4cb7b1aa69f6e2faea2709df) from 2 contributors.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): Added tab to [preview](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1018) proposal text, completed feature to [view difference](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1004) between proposal versions. {is the differ complete or needs more work? is it deployed?}, default comment sort option [set to](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1034) Top, added feature to set sort in the URL. Many bugs were fixed.

In terms of code infrastructure, several parts of contractor management system landed in master, completed several steps of refactoring to fix accumulated layer violations and better support contractor management system, test coverage [increased](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/727) from 13% to 19%.

A bug was detected that allowed advanced users to cast votes beyond the end of the voting period. The fix was deployed on Mar 13.

> The reassuring part about Politeia is that all of the data is publicly available and is periodically timestamped onto the Decred blockchain. This means that anyone can pull the data down from github and cryptographically verify which votes were cast within the voting period (+/- 1 hour) and which ones were cast after the voting period had ended. (@lukebp in [Politeia Digest 12](https://richardred0x.github.io/politeia-digest/issue-012.html))

{where is the issue or PR for the fix? is it [#742](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/742)?}

Merged a total of 40 commits in [politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia/compare/8057ced5e4c0a04823a261cc064602f1a8a2ab1b...13eb0038975ff4fcddb70565687434354d208a0f) and [politeiagui](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/compare/52c775330beb1b77ed817c85bccaaf2a8e199cdc...72885ed6e58c8a2f1bfbd2d039f6cd19b52912fe) from 6-9 contributors.

[dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): minor bug fixes, Chinese translation added, speed optimizations for viewing the transaction history.

[dcrios](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): dcrios beta is in good shape and ready for more public exposure. Testers are welcome and they can get the app at [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/dvq51tCh). There are only a couple of minor outstanding bugs. There are known layout bugs for iPod Touch devices which are still in the works. The blocker at the moment is dealing with some formalities to approve Apple Store account. As soon as that is done, an official release client will be made.

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): Version 4 [released](https://twitter.com/decredexplorer/status/1110618796975370240) and is available at [explorer.dcrdata.org](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/).

User facing changes include complete redesign with new page styles, more information and better organization, Politeia proposal pages, aggregate block information on time intervals, log and linear scaling for charts, exchange rate monitoring, and lots of smaller changes. It is rumored that the HODL watermark is gone. For development side check the full [release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/releases/tag/v4.0.0).

During 3 months of development, the v4 release received a stunning 48K added and 19K deleted lines in 325 commits from 11 contributors. Congrats!

> There are features and improvements already brewing 4.1, so minor release should follow relatively quickly. 4.0 scope creeped quite a bit, but all for good reason, and it was worth it. ([@chappjc](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$155305431834229kjptE:decred.org))

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): v0.7.6 [released](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/releases/tag/v0.7.6) that optimizes the fetching of unspent outputs from dcrdata and adds macOS binaries.

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): new detailed [Ticket Splitting](https://docs.decred.org/proof-of-stake/ticket-splitting/) guide, [Consensus Rules Voting](https://docs.decred.org/governance/consensus-rule-voting/consensus-rules-voting/) reworked and extended, [Proposal Guidelines](https://docs.decred.org/governance/politeia/proposal-guidelines/) updated to include key requirements for proposals funded from Treasury.

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb): updated exchanges and translations, [self-hosted](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/604) intro video to remove a YouTube request.

Other:

* Raedah Group is experimenting with an alternative [godcr](https://github.com/raedahgroup/godcr/) wallet client written in Go with multiple user interface modes. Work is in progress for CLI, terminal _(yes!)_, web browser, [nucular](https://github.com/aarzilli/nucular) and [Fyne](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne) GUI front-ends ([screenshots](https://matrix.to/#/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$155329781839253ivNYC:decred.org)).
* Raedah Group is also working on [dcrseedgen](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrseedgen) - a standalone Decred seed generator using Go and the nucular UI.
* [timestamp.decred.org](https://timestamp.decred.org/) was redesigned and the text was rewritten to be more useful.
* New [dcrtime_checker](https://github.com/decred/dcrtime/tree/master/cmd/dcrtime_checker) tool was created to verify anchors against the blockchain directly (without interacting with dcrtimed).
* About half VSPs upgraded to [self-host captcha](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/279) to protect privacy of their users. Status can be tracked [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/326).

## People

Welcome to new first time contributors with code merged to master: @devwarrior ([atomicswap](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/commits?author=devwarrior-cool)) and DominicTing ([dcrweb](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/588)).

## Governance

In March the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 16,288 DCR and spent 13,595 DCR. Using March's daily average DCR/USD rate of $18.14, this is $296K received and $247K spent. As these payments were for work completed in Feb, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the Feb average daily rate of $16.51 - in which case the USD received/spent figures are $269K/$224K. As of {date}, Treasury balance is {} DCR ({} million USD at ${}).

Proposal status as of {}:

* [Trust Wallet integration](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2ababdea7da2b3d8312a773d477272135a883ed772ba99cdf31eddb5f261d571) approved by 67% Yes of the 9.3K tickets that voted. Ahead of the vote, Trust Wallet developers [moved forward](https://github.com/TrustWallet/wallet-core/issues/43) to integrate Decred on their end.
* [ATM Integration - Planning Phase](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/aea224a561cfed183f514a9ac700d68ba8a6c71dfbee71208fb9bff5fffab51d) rejected with 52.5% Yes among 12.7K voting tickets. Possibility of a second attempt was discussed [here](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$15542882616188dHEHP:decred.org).
* Re-submission of the Coffee Wallet [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/45de9806c952c5ffc2fc6782fddbc74c852c26e3fb0e950144b92d75082c4731) after it was abandoned was [blocked](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$155144086813111EMAcC:decred.org) by admins as an attempt to use Politeia to market the product.
* [Decentralize Treasury Spending](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f) by @moo31337 outlines 2-step process where a draft spending transaction is published on Politeia for review, and then voted on-chain by the stakeholders. The development, testing and a required consensus vote are projected to be on the order of 9-12 months, with the budget of $200,000-250,000.
* [Fiat pairs integration on EXMO Exchange](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/950e8149e594b01c010c1199233ab11e82c9da39174ba375d286dc72bb0a54d7) by vadymprykhodko was published following a [pre-proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/b0y9le/integration_on_exmo_exchange_new_fiat_pairs/) on r/decred. The proposal seeks $23,800 to add DCR fiat pairs on EXMO, an exchange popular in Eastern Europe.
* [Amendment to Decred Constitution](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fd56bb79e0383f40fc2d92f4473634c59f1aa0abda7aabe29079216202c83114) by @richardred was submitted following a lot of discussion linked in [this issue](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/107).

Pre-proposals:

* [India education and awareness campaign](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/awb5y0/preproposal_decred_india_community_new_user/) by u/Blocknext. In a chat [discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$15515162772723165JzrFj:matrix.org) it was pointed out that a [similar proposal](https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/building-commercial-dash-use-in-the-freelancing-industry-across-south-asia.17890/) was submitted for Dash.
* [Second constitutional amendment](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/b84t6b/preproposal_second_constitutional_amendment_to/) by @richardred to declare February 8th the International day of Stakey.

decredcommunity.org got some [criticism](https://matrix.to/#/!lbzTjhzNbIaDbuAxkS:decred.org/$155227203622209rOKeX:decred.org) for not being open source and not explicitly stating it in the body of the proposal. One of the arguments is that the Treasury never paid for closed source work before, except for some integrations where it could not be disclosed. Captured in [this issue](https://github.com/karamble/dcrcommunityweb/issues/1), the discussion also triggered some [improvements](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/896) in proposal guidelines to state any restrictions on deliverables.

@richardred posted an [analysis](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/pi-research/blob/master/analysis/voting/early-voting-influence.md) exploring to what degree early votes influence the behavior of late voters, and eventually the result of the vote.

For greater detail, analysis and commentary see @richardred's Politeia Digest [issue 12](https://richardred0x.github.io/politeia-digest/issue-012.html) and [issue 13](https://richardred0x.github.io/politeia-digest/issue-013.html).

Discussions:

* The rate of [spending the Treasury](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/b5vlrl/we_have_spent_23_of_decred_treasury_should_we_be/) and allocation of funds.
* @richardred suggested to base the quorum solely on the percentage of [Yes votes](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/729) (currently Yes+No votes are counted) and produced a [simulation](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/pi-research/blob/master/analysis/voting/quorum-change-examples.md) that visualizes different quorum calculation methods.

## Network

Hashrate: March's hashrate varied between the low of 221 Ph/s and a new ATH of 570 Ph/s. During first half of the month the average held around 320 Ph/s but went above 400 Ph/s towards the end. Pool hashrate distribution as of Apr 1: F2Pool 23%, Poolin 20%, lab.antpool.com 16%, BTC.com 12%, UUPool 11%, Luxor 3.2%, CoinMine 0.4% and others 14% per dcrstats.com. Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was 112.3 DCR (+0.6) on Apr 1 per dcrstats.com. The price varied between 108.6-117.9 DCR. Locked amount was 4.47-4.61 million DCR, which corresponded to 46.9-48.6% of the available supply.

Nodes: As of Apr 1 there were 191 public listening nodes and 336 normal nodes per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats). Version distribution: v1.5.0 dev builds: 6.3% (-2.3%), v1.4.0: 55% (+12%), v1.4.0 dev and rc builds: 5% (-2%), v1.3.0: 17% (-6%), v1.2.0: 9.5% (-0.5%), v1.1.2: 4%, v1.1.0: 1.7% (-0.3%).

## Mining

* New mining pool appeared as shown by [dcrstats](https://dcrstats.com/pow): [lab.antpool.com](http://lab.antpool.com/).
* This Chinese [support page](https://support.okex.com/hc/zh-cn/articles/360024177931-%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E5%B8%81%E7%A7%8D) suggests OKEx has a new mining pool for Decred.
* Scott Offord [announced](https://twitter.com/offordscott/status/1111714556529831936) on Twitter that MicroBT sells last 200 units of Whatsminer D1 at $750 each and doesn't plan any more Decred miners after that.

## Integrations

OKCoin [announced](https://twitter.com/OKCoin/status/1105892924586258434) the listing of DCR pairs against BTC, ETH and USD, adding another fiat on-ramp for DCR. The news followed a joint [event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/decred-okcoin-present-the-next-10-years-crypto-boom-bust-or-buidl-tickets-57549671617) in San Francisco.

[CoinText](https://cointext.io/) added [DCR support](https://twitter.com/vinarmani/status/1111034078847995905). The service allows to send DCR to anyone with a phone in the US and Canada. Do read up on how the service works and use appropriate caution and small amounts.

## Outreach

March was one of the most successful months in the history of the Decred-Ditto relationship. From helping organize an incredibly successful event at OKCoin offices in San Francisco, to securing a feature article in The Wall Street Journal, Ditto and Decred made some major waves in the space. Ditto lost count of how many other crypto companies and enthusiasts reached out to them just to congratulate Ditto/Decred on WSJ and compliment them on a fantastic event.

Ditto's March achievements:

* Secured a [feature article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gerons-take-decred-aims-to-reach-cryptos-decentralized-ideals-11552523191) on Decred in The Wall Street Journal by facilitating multiple interviews with Jake Yocom-Piatt and Chris Burniske of Placeholder VC. More than any media coverage generated thus far, this article most effectively described Decred to a broad, non-crypto, mainstream audience of financial decision-makers - significantly enhancing its visibility and credibility outside the crypto world. Text available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/b12z34/gerons_take_decred_aims_to_reach_cryptos/eiiwnpm/), and an interesting backstory [here](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$155268940829940XRdUb:decred.org).
* Secured an in-depth [technical profile](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/03/20/decred-an-experiment-in-on-chain-governance/) of Decred in The Block. Plain text version [here](https://pastebin.com/Dg2ELYat).
* Facilitated 5 interviews: background interview with Laura Shin (the host of the Unchained/Unconfirmed podcasts), 2 interviews with a CryptoBriefing analyst for an in-depth research report, one with The Block that resulted in a longer-form profile of Decred, and one with WSJ that resulted in a feature article.
* Helped organize and put on the OKCoin-Decred listing event, which was a huge success - about 110 people attended, including a lot of vcs and crypto CEOs. Ditto received a lot of compliments, and the fact that so many people stayed to network long after the event had ended speaks to its quality. Chris Burniske and Alex Evans fro Placeholder VC, as well as Jake, spoke at the event and drew a great crowd.
* Attended the first inaugural Decred meetup in San Francisco, which thanks to the organizers had an awesome turnout of 60+ people.
* Provided format and content ideas for the Decred Assembly videos.
* Drafted high-level messaging around how ticketing works (pending).
* Drafted a byline on the Treasury for investinblockchain.com, which [went live](https://www.investinblockchain.com/put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is-decreds-treasury-proposal-closer-true-dae/) in April.

For more detail and smaller items see Ditto's biweekly updates from [Mar 1](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$155148239113862OPjOD:decred.org), [Mar 15](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$155268940829940XRdUb:decred.org) and [Mar 29](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$1553889088955UNmaG:decred.org).

Discussions:

* [Revisited](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$155298850932396heGyM:decred.org) an [old idea](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/66) to give "decentralized credits" more visibility.
* An [question](https://matrix.to/#/!lbzTjhzNbIaDbuAxkS:decred.org/$155309851735051wGBlh:decred.org) whether Decred needs a more specific term than "skin in the game" which is hackneyed, vague and used by many crypto projects. The decision to forgo liquidity on exchange for the right to participate in governance warrants a term that is more meaningful and reflective of the difference between Decred and other projects. This and other concepts with floating names are captured in [this issue](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/65).

Some errors in the media are really not that bad:

> Haon: https://crypto.bi/tape/blog/dcr/ - "The founders of decred originally worked on the development of Bitcoin in a project called biscuits."  
> jy-p: working on biscuits for a while gave us the perspective we needed to start decred. our second project, fried chicken, is what led us to create our own louisiana kitchen

A few more gems were found on [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/decred): Decred is a "Private", "For Profit" company, "uses 8 technology products and services including PHP, nginx, and Google Drive", and "is actively using 24 technologies for its website. These include Viewport Meta, IPhone / Mobile Compatible, and SSL by Default". Finally, the team includes 2x Jacob Yocom-Piatt, which partially explains the amount of foresight behind the project.

Comm systems news:

* Stakey stickers are now [available](https://twitter.com/dcrstakey/status/1104032806513115136) in Riot web, Android and iOS Matrix clients. Thanks to @lustosa and Matrix folks for adding! Excited testing of these totally [disrupted](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$155205491220668sKKGI:decred.org) #general. Known issue: Matrix stickers do not cross the bridge to Slack and Discord. Secret hint from @jrick: these stickers are available across the entire Matrix federation and can be used in rooms with no relation to Decred. Use wisely.
* Chinese community members managed to setup a [page](https://www.chainnode.com/forum/305) for Decred discussion on chainnode.com, a rebrand of 8btc.com and one of the largest crypto forums in Chinese. {any stats from there?}
* Transferring of message edits across the chat bridge was disabled, so if you edit message on Discord or Telegram, the edit won't transfer to Matrix (and not produce an annoying duplicate message).
* Right after disabling message edits in our bridge software (matterbridge), an untested code path was hit that took down the bridge for a few hours. The bug was quicly identified by @dhill.
* new [#101](https://matrix.to/#/!MiucsxxSPQBpoidaHN:decred.org) room was started to help beginner and shower thought questions, bridged with Slack, Discord and Telegram. Bridging with Telegram is uncommon because of huge amount of spam on that platform. Previous #telegram bridged room was shutdown for too much spam that wasn't automatically deleted when Telegram moderators deleted it.
* Telegram hardening: @Aztec and team upgraded the "slapper bots" that boot people and bots for bad content, also a "shield bot" was added that does captcha for new room entrants

* Open to feedback until Apr 12, effective Apr 19

Stellar (XLM) [experienced](https://messari.io/article/messari-research-stellar-suffered-and-quietly-patched-a-2-2-billion-xlm-inflation-bug-in-2017) an inflation bug which was exploited to print 2.25 billion XLM (worth $10 million at the time, and nearly 25% of the circulating supply) in April 2017. This bug was lightly reported at the time, it was fixed by the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) who burned an equal amount from its community reserve. That the SDF could identify, fix and mitigate such a major exploit so quietly says something about how decentralized Stellar is.

PIVX experienced an inflation bug which was [exploited](https://medium.com/@dev.pivx/report-wrapped-serials-attack-5f4bf7b51701) in March. The bug concerned the network's zerocoin protocol (zPIV), and allowed an attacker to fake serial numbers and spend zerocoins that had never been minted. Over the course of five days, transactions creating and spending 568,897 PIV (~$438,000) were made before zPIV the exploit was identified and zPIV transactions were disabled until it could be fixed.

Tezos [concluded](https://www.coindesk.com/welcome-to-athens-tezos-completes-historic-first-blockchain-vote) the first round of voting for its Athens upgrade. In this round bakers were choosing from between two versions of the Athens upgrade which increases the gas limit, and they chose the Athens A version which also decreases the minimum roll size and lowers the barrier to entry for bakers. The process has now moved on to its next phase, where bakers must confirm that the selected proposal should proceed to a subsequent testing and confirmation phase.

Jack Dorsey [announced](https://www.coindesk.com/square-hiring-crypto-engineers-bitcoin) Square is looking to fund engineers and a designer to work full-time on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ecosystem, as a way to give back to the community. One [response](https://twitter.com/martybent/status/1108493263185559552) noted that this shows why "dev fund" embedded in a protocol is not needed, because network participants have enough incentives to fund their infrastructure. In case of Decred, if the Treasury is ever deemed no longer necessary, it is in the power stakeholders to repurpose it for investing into a wider crypto/open source/open hardware ecosystem, or disband it entirely.

New research from @BitwiseInvest [suggest](https://twitter.com/BitwiseInvest/status/1109114656944209921) 95% of reported BTC spot volume is fake, but also notes many good news about the crypto ecosystem.

IMF found an [elegant solution](https://blogs.imf.org/2019/02/05/cashing-in-how-to-make-negative-interest-rates-work/) how to make negative interest rates work as a counter-measure to a possible future crisis. Negative interest rate of -3% is when you deposit $100 to a bank and withdraw $97 a year later. Such rate is currently hard to force because people would just hold cash. The "straightforward" solution would be to move into a happy "cashless world" where the bank can set arbitrary negative rate and you simply can't withdraw to cash to save your value from melting. This is expected to "make consumption and investment more attractive, ... jolt lending, boost demand, and stimulate the economy". But getting rid of cash is not easy and is years away. So another solution to sustain a negative interest rate that is easier to roll today is to introduce a floating conversion rate between e-money and cash. This way, in a -3% interest rate scenario, you either deposit 100 dollars into e-dollars and get 97 e-dollars after a year, or hold cash but enjoy a 3% value loss against both e-dollar and goods. The result is there is no benefit to hold cash relative to bank deposits. Disclaimer: this paragraph is written by a layman. Economists are welcome to [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/) how this is healthy at all.

Poloniex [committed](https://medium.com/circle-blog/poloniex-welcomes-grin-commits-to-share-transaction-fees-for-1-year-d07bc92cc0f8) to share a portion of Grin trading fees with Grin General Fund. For the first month, 50% of all fees will be donated, for the next 11 months it will be 25%. Pretty rare and generous act.
