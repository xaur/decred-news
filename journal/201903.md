> \[vote propagation latency is affected by]\ Many factors, but per node avg from ~70ms to sub 5ms on my nodes. Need more data for better values. Good alone, but real gains will come with majority network upgrade since savings are multiplied by num nodes votes traverse (log_8(tot)). Full deployment ~90% overall improvement.

Some errors in the media are really not that bad:

> Haon: https://crypto.bi/tape/blog/dcr/ - "The founders of decred originally worked on the development of Bitcoin in a project called biscuits."  
> jy-p: working on biscuits for a while gave us the perspective we needed to start decred. our second project, fried chicken, is what led us to create our own louisiana kitchen

A few more gems were found on [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/decred): Decred is a "Private", "For Profit" company, "uses 8 technology products and services including PHP, nginx, and Google Drive", and "is actively using 24 technologies for its website. These include Viewport Meta, IPhone / Mobile Compatible, and SSL by Default". Finally, the team includes 2x Jacob Yocom-Piatt, which partially explains the amount of foresight behind the project.

Comm systems news:

* Stakey stickers are now [available](https://twitter.com/dcrstakey/status/1104032806513115136) in Riot web, Android and iOS Matrix clients. Thanks to @lustosa and Matrix folks for adding! Excited testing of these totally [disrupted](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$155205491220668sKKGI:decred.org) #general. Known issue: Matrix stickers do not cross the bridge to Slack and Discord. Secret hint from @jrick: these stickers are available across the entire Matrix federation and can be used in rooms with no relation to Decred. Use wisely.
* Chinese community members managed to setup a [page](https://www.chainnode.com/forum/305) for Decred discussion on chainnode.com, a rebrand of 8btc.com and one of the largest crypto forums in Chinese. {any stats from there?}
* Transferring of message edits across the chat bridge was disabled, so if you edit message on Discord or Telegram, the edit won't transfer to Matrix (and not produce an annoying duplicate message).
* Right after disabling message edits in our bridge software (matterbridge), an untested code path was hit that took down the bridge for a few hours. The bug was quicly identified by @dhill.
* new [#101](https://matrix.to/#/!MiucsxxSPQBpoidaHN:decred.org) room was started to help beginners, bridged with Slack, Discord and Telegram. Bridging with Telegram is uncommon because of huge amount of spam on that platform. Previous #telegram bridged room was shutdown for too much spam that wasn't automatically deleted when Telegram moderators deleted it.

* https://www.coindesk.com/privacy-cryptocurrency-grin-votes-to-fund-third-full-time-developer

Jack Dorsey [announced](https://www.coindesk.com/square-hiring-crypto-engineers-bitcoin) Square is looking to fund engineers and a designer to work full-time on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ecosystem, as a way to give back to the community. One [response](https://twitter.com/martybent/status/1108493263185559552) noted that this shows why "dev fund" embedded in a protocol is not needed, because network participants have enough incentives to fund their infrastructure. In case of Decred, if the Treasury is ever deemed no longer necessary, it is in the power stakeholders to repurpose it for investing into a wider crypto/open source/open hardware ecosystem, or disband it entirely.

New research from @BitwiseInvest [suggest](https://twitter.com/BitwiseInvest/status/1109114656944209921) 95% of reported BTC spot volume is fake, but also notes many good news about the crypto ecosystem.

{related exchanges and websites}

IMF found an [elegant solution](https://blogs.imf.org/2019/02/05/cashing-in-how-to-make-negative-interest-rates-work/) how to make negative interest rates work as a counter-measure to a possible future crisis. Negative interest rate of -3% is when you deposit $100 to a bank and withdraw $97 a year later. Such rate is currently hard to force because people would just hold cash. The "straightforward" solution would be to move into a happy "cashless world" where the bank can set arbitrary negative rate and you simply can't withdraw to cash to save your value from melting. This is expected to "make consumption and investment more attractive, ... jolt lending, boost demand, and stimulate the economy". But getting rid of cash is not easy and is years away. So another solution to sustain a negative interest rate that is easier to roll today is to introduce a floating conversion rate between e-money and cash. This way, in a -3% interest rate scenario, you either deposit 100 dollars into e-dollars and get 97 e-dollars after a year, or hold cash but enjoy a 3% value loss against both e-dollar and goods. The result is there is no benefit to hold cash relative to bank deposits. Disclaimer: this paragraph is written by a layman. Economists are welcome to [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/) how this is healthy at all.

Poloniex [committed](https://medium.com/circle-blog/poloniex-welcomes-grin-commits-to-share-transaction-fees-for-1-year-d07bc92cc0f8) to share a portion of Grin trading fees with Grin General Fund. For the first month, 50% of all fees will be donated, for the next 11 months it will be 25%. Pretty rare and generous act.
