# Decred Journal — May 2018 DRAFT

## Development

dcrd: Significant [optimization](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1179) in signature hash calculation, bloom filters support was [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1162), 2x faster startup thanks to in-memory [full block index](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1229), multipeer work [advancing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1145), stronger [protection](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1235) against majority hashpower attacks. Additionally, code refactoring and cleanup, code and test infrastructure improvements.

In dcrd and dcrwallet developers have been experimenting with new modular dependency and versioning schemes using vgo.

Decrediton: 1.2.1 bugfix [release](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.2.1), work on SPV [has started](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1389), chart additions are in progress. Further simplification of the staking process is in the pipeline ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C5H9Z63AA/p1525528370000062)).

politeia: new [command line tool](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/267) to interact with Politeia API. Help with testing is very welcome, please check this [test plan](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/265) and join [#politeia](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C88HEA7DK) to get started.

dcrdata: work ongoing on [improved design](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/451), adding [more charts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/463) and improving Insight API support.

Android: design work [advancing](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/80).

Decreds own [DNS seeder](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder) was [released](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/996442267538751488). It is written in Go and it properly supports service bit filtering, which will allow SPV nodes to find full nodes that support compact filters.

@orthomind is seeking feedback for his work on [reproducible builds](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/pull/78).

Ticket splitting service by @matheusd [entered](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/997560763727265792) beta and [demonstrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsVJ1WWsWlA) an 11-way split on mainnet. Help with testing is much appreciated, please join [#ticket_splitting](https://decred.slack.com/messages/CAUF860P3/) to participate in splits, but check [this doc](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/blob/master/docs/beta.md) to learn about the risks. Reddit discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8kgrqg/what_many_of_you_have_been_waiting_for_ticket/).

Trezor support is [expected](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1525638426000046) to land in their [next firmware update](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-mcu/milestone/2?closed=1).

Decred is now [supported](https://medium.com/summa-technology/introducing-riemann-7c1c3cb4a52) by Riemann, a toolbox to construct transactions for many UTXO-based chains from human-readable strings.

Atomic swap with Ethereum on testnet was [demonstrated](https://twitter.com/bebrites/status/1001200089283678209) at Blockspot Conference LATAM.

Two new faces were [added](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/commit/9a410a33c2e3dc95405c264523d28c43678123e6) to [contributors](https://decred.org/contributors/) page.

## Network

Hashrate: rapid growth from ~4,000 TH/s at the beginning of the month to ~15,000 at the end with new all time high of 17,949. Interesting dynamic in [hashrate distribution](https://dcred.eu/powStats) across mining pools: coinmine.pl share down from 55% to 25% while F2Pool up from 2% to 44%.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price is 91.3 DCR (+0.8), stake participation is 46.9% (+0.8%) with 3.68 million DCR locked (+0.15). Min price was 85.56. On May 11 ticket price surged to 96.99, staying elevated for longer than usual. Locked DCR peaked at 47.17%. This was [speculated](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8ixay1/decred_investment_thesis_by_placeholder_ventures/dyvpgg5/?context=3) to be a result of a large miner staking.

Nodes: there are 226 public listening and 405 normal nodes per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats). Version distribution: v1.2.0 45% (up from 24% last month), v1.1.2 39%, v1.1.0 15% and 1% running outdaded versions.

Data snapshot from May 31.

## ASICs

Obelisk team [posted](https://medium.com/obelisk-blog/obelisk-update-january-may-2018-739229a930ec) an update. Current hashrate estimate of DCR1 is 1200 GH/s at 500 W and may still change. The chips came back at 40% the speed of the simulated results, it is still unknown why. Batch 1 units may get delayed 1-2 weeks past June 30. See discussions [on r/decred](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8hzhjm/obelisk_update_januarymay_2018_obelisk_blog_medium/) and [on r/siacoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/8hzgkr/obelisk_update_januarymay_2018/).

@SiaBillionaire [estimated](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3P6R055Z/p1526221654000039) 7940 DCR1 units were sold in Batches 1-5, while Lynmar13 [shared](https://medium.com/@brian7249694/the-current-state-of-the-obelisk-dcr1-fff97f6877be) his projections of DCR1 profitability ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8lgbv2/the_current_state_of_the_obelisk_dcr1/)).

New Chinese miner was noticed by our Telegram group. Woodpecker WB2 specs 1.5 TH/s at 1200 W, costs 15,000 CNY (~2,340 USD) and the initial 150 units are expected to ship on Aug 15. ([pow8.com](https://pow8.com/product.php) – [translated](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=https://pow8.com/product.php))

Another new miner is iBelink DSM6T: 6 TH/s at 2100 W costing $6,300 ([ibelink.co](https://ibelink.co/product/ibelink-dsm6t-blake256-miner-with-6-th-s-hash-rate/)). Shipping starts from June 5. Some concerns and links were posted in these [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8kutc4/ibelink_6th_miner/) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8ljg9t/ibelink_decred_miner_available/dzg8f7v/).

## Integrations

A new mining pool is [available](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8hba71/altpool_decred_mining_pool_1_pool_fee_always/) now: [altpool.net](https://altpool.net/). It uses PPLNS model and takes 1% fee.

Another infrastructure addition is [tokensmart.io](https://tokensmart.io/), a newly audited stake pool with 0.8% fee. There are a total of 14 [stake pools](https://decred.org/stakepools/) now.

Moving on to exchange integrations, Upbit added [DCR/KRW](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/992453050425008128) and [DCR/USDT](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1001885561127292928) pairs. Deposits and withdrawals of DCR are [reportedly](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1526859809000035) now available.

CoinEx [announced](https://twitter.com/coinexcom/status/994127050305777664) the launch of DCR/BTC and DCR/BCH pairs.

Bleutrade [added](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/999309765414039554) DCR/USDT pair. Note their [reply](https://twitter.com/BLEUTRADE/status/999683568791060481) to our tweet. It was the first exchange to list Decred minutes after launch.

Brazilian exchange [OmniTrade](https://omnitrade.io/) [added](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/999714011544350720) DCR/BRL fiat pair following a [poll](https://twitter.com/omnitrade_br/status/993294188795056128). Worth noting that it is one of the first to [integrate](https://twitter.com/omnitrade_br/status/976236441297719296) Trezor sign-in.

Bittrex [added](https://twitter.com/bittrexexchange/status/999811198723022853) [DCR/USDT pair](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=USDT-DCR).

Cryptopia silently enabled [DCR/USDT](https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Exchange?market=DCR_USDT) pair too.

OpenBazaar [released](https://twitter.com/openbazaar/status/996526909587705856) an update that allows one to trade cryptocurrencies, including DCR.

Blockfolio rolled out Signal Beta with Decred [in the list](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/995361130821378051). Users who own or watch a coin will automatically receive updates pushed by project teams. Nice to see this Journal made it to the screenshot!

Placeholder Ventures [announced](https://twitter.com/placeholdervc/status/995339882867380224) that Decred is their [first](https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/995340580673769475) public investment. Their [Investment Thesis](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2018/5/12/decred-investment-thesis) is a clear and well researched overview of Decred. Among other great points it noted the less obvious benefit of not doing an ICO:

> By choosing not to pre-sell coins to speculators, the financial rewards from Decred’s growth most favor those who work for the network.

Alex Evans, a cryptoeconomics researcher who recently [joined](https://twitter.com/placeholdervc/status/1002216891446976512) Placeholder, [posted](https://twitter.com/alexhevans/status/1002232216875872257) his 13-page [Decred Network Analysis](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPBqq3g3LuXiauZdaEcNtQUQ3QUTJUSnT8XuBXPw2be6V/Decred%20Analysis%20-%20Alex.pdf).

## Marketing

@R3VoLuT1OneR posted a [proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8jbhgc/decred_cryptocurrency_scholarship_proposal/) for Decred to offer scholarships for students.

[r/dcrtrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dcrtrader/) received a couple of new moderators, weekly automatic threads were reconfigured to monthly and empty threads were removed. Currently most trading talk happens on #trading and some leaks to [r/decred](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/), but a separate trading sub offers some advantages: free speech and transparent moderation, in addition to standard reddit threaded discussion, permanent history and search.

Twitter: decent [response](https://twitter.com/nwoodfine/status/999181111115661312) by @jm_buirski to shallow criticism of governance as "imagined problem".

Slack: the [#governance](https://decred.slack.com/messages/CAAMEU56W/) channel created last month has seen many intelligent conversations on topics including: finite attention of decision makers, why stakeholders _can_ make good decisions (opposed to a common narrative than only developers are capable of making good decisions), proposal funding and contractor pre-qualification, Cardano and Dash treasuries, quadratic voting, equality of outcome vs equality of opportunity, and much more. One particularly important issue being discussed is the observation that several people are very vocal in criticizing on-chain governance and coin voing.

## Markets

The month of May has seen Decred earn some much deserved attention in the markets. New trading pairs and recognition from established financial figures has contributed to the gains. DCR started the month around 0.009 BTC and finished around 0.0125 with interim high of 0.0165 on Bittrex. In terms of USD it started around $81 and finished around $92, temporarily rising to $118. During a period in which most altcoins suffered, Decred has been markedly uncorrelated; rising from rank #45 to #30 on Coinmarketcap.

The addition of a much awaited KRW pair on Upbit saw the price briefly double on some exchanges. This pair opens up direct DCR to fiat trading in one of the largest cryptocurrency markets in the world.

May has really been a fantastic month for Decred, news-wise. Price influencing events include: the attendance of several Decred team members at Consensus 2018, the beta launch of ticket splitting toolset by @matheusd, Placeholder VC's bold "Decred Investment Thesis", and both Innosilicon AND iBeLink's surprise launches of yet 2 more Decred ASIC. The controversial independent Weiss crypto report has ranked Decred as one of the top 3 cryptocurrencies. Decred's uniquely secure hybrid PoW/PoS system has also started to get some attention following several high profile hashpower attacks.

@sumiflow made good progress on correcting Decred market cap on several sites:

> speaking of market cap, I got it corrected on coingecko, cryptocompare, and worldcoinindex  
> onchainfx, livecoinwatch, and cryptoindex.co said they would update it about a month ago but haven't yet  
> I messaged coinlib.io today but haven't got a response yet
> coinmarketcap refused to correct it until they can verify certain funds have moved from dev wallets which is most likely forever unknowable ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1526502065000421))
