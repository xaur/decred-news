# Decred Journal — May 2018 DRAFT

## Development

dcrd: Significant [optimization](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1179) in signature hash calculation, bloom filters support was [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1162), 2x faster startup thanks to in-memory [full block index](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1229), multipeer work [advancing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1145), stronger [protection](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1235) against majority hashpower attacks. Aside that, code refactoring and cleanup, code and test infrastructure improvements.

In dcrd and dcrwallet developers experiment with new modular dependency and versioning scheme using vgo.

Decrediton: 1.2.1 bugfix [release](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.2.1), work on SPV [has started](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1389), chart additions in progress, further simplification of staking process is in the pipeline ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C5H9Z63AA/p1525528370000062)).

politeia: new [command line tool](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/267) to interact with Politeia API. Help with testing is much welcome, please check this [test plan](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/265) and join [#politeia](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C88HEA7DK) to get started.

dcrdata: work ongoing on [improved design](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/451), adding [more charts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/463) and improving Insight API support.

Android: design work [advancing](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/80).

Decreds own [DNS seeder](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder) was [released](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/996442267538751488). It is written in Go and it properly supports service bit filtering, which will allow SPV nodes to find full nodes that support compact filters.

@orthomind is seeking feedback for his work on [reproducible builds](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/pull/78).

Ticket splitting service by @matheusd [entered](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/997560763727265792) beta and [showed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsVJ1WWsWlA) a 11-way split on mainnet. Help with testing is much appreciated, please join [#ticket_splitting](https://decred.slack.com/messages/CAUF860P3/) to participate in splits, but check [this doc](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/blob/master/docs/beta.md) to learn about the risks. Reddit discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8kgrqg/what_many_of_you_have_been_waiting_for_ticket/).

> jz: Trezor support for Decred is set to drop in their next firmware update, they actually do those pretty often. https://github.com/trezor/trezor-mcu/milestone/2?closed=1 ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1525638426000046))

Decred is now [supported](https://medium.com/summa-technology/introducing-riemann-7c1c3cb4a52) by Riemann, a toolbox to construct transactions for many UTXO-based chains from human-readable strings.

Atomic swap with Ethereum on testnet was [demonstrated](https://twitter.com/bebrites/status/1001200089283678209) at Blockspot Conference LATAM.

Two new faces were [added](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/commit/9a410a33c2e3dc95405c264523d28c43678123e6) to [contributors](https://decred.org/contributors/) page.

## Network

Hashrate: rapid growth from ~4,000 TH/s at the beginning of the month to ~15,000 at the end with new all time high of 17,949. Interesting dynamic in [hashrate distribution](https://dcred.eu/powStats) across mining pools: coinmine.pl share down from 55% to 25% while F2Pool up from 2% to 44%.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price is 91.3 DCR (+0.8), stake participation is 46.9% (+0.8%) with 3.68 million DCR locked (+0.15). Min price was 85.56. On May 11 ticket price surged to 96.99 with elevated ticket price staying longer than usual. Locked DCR peaked at 47.17%. This was [speculated](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8ixay1/decred_investment_thesis_by_placeholder_ventures/dyvpgg5/?context=3) to be a result of large miner staking.

Nodes: there are 226 public listening and 405 normal nodes per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats). Version distribution: v1.2.0 45% (up from 24% last month), v1.1.2 39%, v1.1.0 15% and 1% running outdaded versions.

Data snapshot from May 31.

Decred Cryptocurrency Scholarship Proposal from @R3VoLuT1OneR https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8jbhgc/decred_cryptocurrency_scholarship_proposal/

r/dcrtrader received couple new moderators, weekly automatic threads were reconfigured to monthly and empty threads were removed. Currently most trading talk happens on #trading and some leaks to r/decred, but separate trading sub offers some advantages: free speech and transparent moderation, in addition to standard reddit threaded discussion, permanent history and search.

Twitter: Decent response by @jm_buirski to shallow criticism of governance as "imagined problem" https://twitter.com/nwoodfine/status/999181111115661312

Slack:

* The #governance channel created last month has seen some very intelligent conversations on topics including: finite attention of decision makers, why stakeholders _can_ make good decisions (opposed to a common narrative than only developers are entitled to make good decisions), proposal funding and contractor pre-qualification, Cardano and Dash treasuries, quadratic voting, equality of outcome vs equality of opportunity, and much more.

One particularly important thing being discussed is the observation how several people criticize on-chain governance and coin voing. It is important for us to "start shaping the narrative". (TODO: worthy?)

sumiflow made good progress on correcting Decred market cap on several sites:

> speaking of market cap, I got it corrected on coingecko, cryptocompare, and worldcoinindex  
> onchainfx, livecoinwatch, and cryptoindex.co said they would update it about a month ago but haven't yet  
> I messaged coinlib.io today but haven't got a response yet
> coinmarketcap refused to correct it until they can verify certain funds have moved from dev wallets which is most likely forever unknowable ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1526502065000421))

Three pure PoW coins were attacked this month, one attempting at ASIC resistance. This shows the importance of Decred's PoS layer that adds security by itself and allows to welcome ASIC miners for more PoW security without sacrificing sovereignty to them:
