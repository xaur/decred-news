# Decred Journal — May 2018 DRAFT

## Development

dcrd: Significant [optimization](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1179) in signature hash calculation, bloom filters support was [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1162), 2x faster startup thanks to in-memory [full block index](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1229), multipeer work [advancing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1145), stronger [protection](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1235) against majority hashpower attacks. Additionally, code refactoring and cleanup, code and test infrastructure improvements.

In dcrd and dcrwallet developers have been [experimenting](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1223) with new modular dependency and versioning schemes using vgo. @orthomind is seeking feedback for his work on [reproducible builds](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/pull/78).

Decrediton: 1.2.1 bugfix [release](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.2.1), work on SPV [has started](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1389), chart additions are in progress. Further simplification of the staking process is in the pipeline ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C5H9Z63AA/p1525528370000062)).

Politeia: new [command line tool](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/267) to interact with Politeia API, general development is ongoing. Help with testing will soon be welcome: this [test plan](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/265)  sets out a test plan, join [#politeia](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C88HEA7DK) to follow progress and partiicpate in testing.

dcrdata: work ongoing on [improved design](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/451), adding [more charts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/463) and improving Insight API support.

Android: design work [advancing](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/80).

Decred's own [DNS seeder](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder) (dcrseeder) was [released](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/996442267538751488). It is written in Go and it properly supports service bit filtering, which will allow SPV nodes to find full nodes that support compact filters.

Ticket splitting service by @matheusd [entered](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/997560763727265792) beta and [demonstrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsVJ1WWsWlA) an 11-way split on mainnet. Help with testing is much appreciated, please join [#ticket_splitting](https://decred.slack.com/messages/CAUF860P3/) to participate in splits, but check [this doc](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/blob/master/docs/beta.md) to learn about the risks. Reddit discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8kgrqg/what_many_of_you_have_been_waiting_for_ticket/).

Trezor support is [expected](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1525638426000046) to land in their [next firmware update](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-mcu/milestone/2?closed=1).

Decred is now [supported](https://medium.com/summa-technology/introducing-riemann-7c1c3cb4a52) by Riemann, a toolbox to construct transactions for many UTXO-based chains from human-readable strings.

Atomic swap with Ethereum on testnet was [demonstrated](https://twitter.com/bebrites/status/1001200089283678209) at Blockspot Conference LATAM.

Two new faces were [added](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/commit/9a410a33c2e3dc95405c264523d28c43678123e6) to [contributors](https://decred.org/contributors/) page.

Dev activity stats for May: 238 active PRs, 195 master commits, 32,831 added and 22,280 deleted lines spread across 8 repositories. Contributions came from 4-10 developers per repository. ([chart](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1002963653778214912))

## Network

Hashrate: rapid growth from ~4,000 TH/s at the beginning of the month to ~15,000 at the end with new all time high of 17,949. Interesting dynamic in [hashrate distribution](https://dcred.eu/powStats) across mining pools: coinmine.pl share down from 55% to 25% while F2Pool up from 2% to 44%.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price is 91.3 DCR (+0.8), stake participation is 46.9% (+0.8%) with 3.68 million DCR locked (+0.15). Min price was 85.56. On May 11 ticket price surged to 96.99, staying elevated for longer than usual after such a pump. Locked DCR peaked at 47.17%. [nrpalao](https://www.reddit.com/user/nrpalao) on reddit [suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8ixay1/decred_investment_thesis_by_placeholder_ventures/dyvpgg5/?context=3) that the DCR for these tickets likely came from a miner with significant hashrate.

Nodes: there are 226 public listening and 405 normal nodes per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats). Version distribution: 45% on v1.2.0 (up from 24% last month), 39% on v1.1.2, 15% on v1.1.0 and 1% running outdaded versions.

Data snapshot from May 31.

## ASICs

Obelisk team [posted](https://medium.com/obelisk-blog/obelisk-update-january-may-2018-739229a930ec) an update. Current hashrate estimate of DCR1 is 1200 GH/s at 500 W and may still change. The chips came back at 40% the speed of the simulated results, it is still unknown why. Batch 1 units may get delayed 1-2 weeks past June 30. See discussions [on r/decred](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8hzhjm/obelisk_update_januarymay_2018_obelisk_blog_medium/) and [on r/siacoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/8hzgkr/obelisk_update_januarymay_2018/).

@SiaBillionaire [estimated](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3P6R055Z/p1526221654000039) that 7940 DCR1 units were sold in Batches 1-5, while Lynmar13 [shared](https://medium.com/@brian7249694/the-current-state-of-the-obelisk-dcr1-fff97f6877be) his projections of DCR1 profitability ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8lgbv2/the_current_state_of_the_obelisk_dcr1/)).

A new Chinese miner for sale was noticed by our Telegram group. Woodpecker WB2 specs 1.5 TH/s at 1200 W, costs 15,000 CNY (~2,340 USD) and the initial 150 units are expected to ship on Aug 15. ([pow8.com](https://pow8.com/product.php) – [translated](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=https://pow8.com/product.php))

Another new miner is iBelink DSM6T: 6 TH/s at 2100 W costing $6,300 ([ibelink.co](https://ibelink.co/product/ibelink-dsm6t-blake256-miner-with-6-th-s-hash-rate/)). Shipping starts from June 5. Some concerns and links were posted in these [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8kutc4/ibelink_6th_miner/) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8ljg9t/ibelink_decred_miner_available/dzg8f7v/).

Blockfolio rolled out Signal Beta with Decred [in the list](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/995361130821378051). Users who own or watch a coin will automatically receive updates pushed by project teams. Nice to see this Journal made it to the screenshot!

Placeholder Ventures [announced](https://twitter.com/placeholdervc/status/995339882867380224) that Decred is their [first](https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/995340580673769475) public investment. Their [Investment Thesis](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2018/5/12/decred-investment-thesis) is a clear and well researched overview of Decred. Among other great points it noted the less obvious benefit of not doing an ICO:

> By choosing not to pre-sell coins to speculators, the financial rewards from Decred’s growth most favor those who work for the network.

Alex Evans, a cryptoeconomics researcher who recently joined Placeholder, [posted](https://twitter.com/alexhevans/status/1002232216875872257) his 13-page [Decred Network Analysis](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPBqq3g3LuXiauZdaEcNtQUQ3QUTJUSnT8XuBXPw2be6V/Decred%20Analysis%20-%20Alex.pdf).

## Marketing

@Dustorf [published](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C0NRMDVMJ/p1525888252000305) March-April survey results ([pdf](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0NRMDTJQ-FALG3RB2M/decred_march.april_user_survey_results.pdf)). It analyzes 166 responses and has lots of interesting data. Just an example:

> "I own DECRED because I saw a YouTube video with DECRED Jesus and after seeing it I was sold."

@R3VoLuT1OneR posted a preview of a [proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8jbhgc/decred_cryptocurrency_scholarship_proposal/) from his company for Decred to offer scholarships for students.

[r/dcrtrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dcrtrader/) gained a couple of new moderators, weekly automatic threads were reconfigured to monthly and empty threads were removed. Currently most trading talk happens on #trading and some leaks to [r/decred](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/), but a separate trading sub offers some advantages: free speech and transparent moderation, in addition to standard reddit threaded discussion, permanent history and search.

Forum: potential [social attacks](https://forum.decred.org/threads/a-potential-social-attack-on-decred.5995/) on Decred.

Slack: the [#governance](https://decred.slack.com/messages/CAAMEU56W/) channel created last month has seen many intelligent conversations on topics including: finite attention of decision makers, why stakeholders _can_ make good decisions (opposed to a common narrative than only developers are capable of making good decisions), proposal funding and contractor pre-qualification, Cardano and Dash treasuries, quadratic voting, equality of outcome vs equality of opportunity, and much more.

One particularly important issue being discussed is the growing number of posts arguing that on-chain governance and coin voting is bad. Just a few examples from Twitter: Decred is solving an [imagined problem](https://twitter.com/nwoodfine/status/999181111115661312) (decent [response](https://twitter.com/jm_buirski/status/999271148348170241) by @jm_buirski), we [convince](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/999691029514252289) ourselves that we need governance and ticket price algo vote was not controversial, on-chain governance [hurts](https://twitter.com/panekkkk/status/999758289230589952) node operators and it is [too early](https://twitter.com/panekkkk/status/999758294750257153) for it, it [robs](https://twitter.com/VladZamfir/status/935587447584440320) node operators of their role, crypto risks being [captured](https://twitter.com/VladZamfir/status/999921949370269698) by the wealthy, it is a [huge threat](https://twitter.com/VladZamfir/status/935589574075543552) to the whole public blockchain space, coin holders [should not](https://twitter.com/VladZamfir/status/971379367187230720) own the blockchain.

## Markets

The month of May has seen Decred earn some much deserved attention in the markets. DCR started the month around 0.009 BTC and finished around 0.0125 with interim high of 0.0165 on Bittrex. In USD terms it started around $81 and finished around $92, temporarily rising to $118. During a period in which most altcoins suffered, Decred has performed well; rising from rank #45 to #30 on Coinmarketcap.

The addition of a much awaited KRW pair on Upbit saw the price briefly double on some exchanges. This pair opens up direct DCR to fiat trading in one of the largest cryptocurrency markets in the world.

May has really been a fantastic month for Decred, news-wise. Highlights include: the attendance of several Decred team members at Consensus 2018, the beta launch of ticket splitting toolset by @matheusd, Placeholder VC's bold "Decred Investment Thesis", and iBeLink's surprise launch of yet another Decred ASIC. The controversial independent Weiss crypto report has ranked Decred as one of the top 3 cryptocurrencies. Decred's uniquely secure hybrid PoW/PoS system has also started to get some attention following several high profile hashpower attacks.

@i2Rav started posting OTC quotes on [#trading](https://decred.slack.com/messages/C3PBR19L4/) channel:

> We have begun trading DCR in large volume daily. The interest around DCR has really started to grow in terms of OTC quote requests. More and more customers are asking about trading it.

This shows the importance of Decred's PoS layer that exerts control over miners and allows Decred to welcome ASIC miners for more PoW security without sacrificing sovereignty to them.

Upbit was [raided](https://www.coindesk.com/koreas-biggest-crypto-exchange-raided-over-suspected-fraud-report/) over suspected fraud and put under investigation.

@sumiflow made good progress on correcting Decred market cap on several sites:

> speaking of market cap, I got it corrected on coingecko, cryptocompare, and worldcoinindex  
> onchainfx, livecoinwatch, and cryptoindex.co said they would update it about a month ago but haven't yet  
> I messaged coinlib.io today but haven't got a response yet  
> coinmarketcap refused to correct it until they can verify certain funds have moved from dev wallets which is most likely forever unknowable ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1526502065000421))

## About This Issue

Some source links point to Slack messages. Although Slack hides history older than ~5 days, you can read individual messages if you paste the message link into chat with yourself. Digging the full conversation is hard but possible. The history of all channels bridged to Matrix is saved in Matrix. Therefore it is possible to dig history in Matrix if you know the timestamp of the first message. Slack links encode the timestamp: `https://decred.slack.com/archives/C5H9Z63AA/p1525528370000062` => `1525528370` => `2018-05-05 13:52:50`.

Most information from third parties is relayed directly from source with a minimal sanity check. The authors of Decred Journal have no ability to verify all claims. Please beware of scams and do your own research.
