# Decred Update — April 2018

## Development

Wallet and node software version 1.2.0 has been released. Decrediton wallet highlights: improved startup experience, redesigned overview page, added basic graphs to visualize statistics and an export to CSV (helpful for tax reporting). dcrd node software highlights: significantly faster startup and compact filters to support light clients. See full release notes and downloads [here](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.2.0). Note: for Decrediton use [1.2.1](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.2.1) bugfix release.

The release process has seen an introduction of Release Candidates. It used to be: announce release date, rush to meet it and miss bugs. Now it is: don't call release date, post Release Candidate 1 (RC1) and let people start testing it, fix bugs and release RC2, repeat. An RC version with no apparent bugs becomes the final release. This new process removes a ton of pressure from developers and users and gives more time for testing. As our primary consumer-facing product, Decrediton, is growing in features and complexity, more testing will be required for new releases.

Politeia is "Getting close to a public beta of voting" ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C0NRMDVMJ/p1523623105000168)). Decred plugin [merged](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/242), paywall and voting are in the testing stage. Ticket voting [works](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/984518284757221376) on testnet via CLI.

Trezor support advanced with Decred PR [merged](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-mcu/pull/274). Please note this is only firmware support, to be usable it also needs wallet integration.

WooCommerce [Decred plugin](https://github.com/xifrat/decred-woocommerce-plugin) alpha version is ready for testing.

Website received a new sleek [exchanges](https://decred.org/exchanges/) page and many additions to a list of [contributors](https://decred.org/contributors/).

Dev activity stats for April: 152 active PRs, 125 commits, 21,656 added and 10,288 deleted lines spread across 7 repositories done by 2-7 developers per repository. ([chart](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/991734153631563776))

## ASICs

Updates from Obelisk's Taek:

> We got results back. They are more or less on line with the simulations\
> I didn't realize this, but we don't get the real chips back for 3 more weeks. The ones we've been testing are hacked together into a DIP package (they are BGA chips) that really screws up the results\
> There's a decent chance that the full bga chips perform better\
> For the time being though, we're pretty much on track for the hashrates estimated on the website ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3P6R055Z/p1523504966000203), Apr 12)

Thank you for updating us on our #pow-mining channel, let's hope other ASIC manufacturers also join.

> We're still on track for batch 1. We've ordered most of the parts we'll need, including the chips. We've got working chips, we've got test boards, test units, test everything. We've signed manufacturers to produce everything. Obelisk is going strong. ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/8edjy8/obelisk_batch_1_updates/dxuoayz/), Apr 23)

Fellow Sia miners are [discussing](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/8eo1x5/first_look_at_obelisk_unit/) the design of Obelisk SC1 case.

Halong: B29 units are shipping. The amount of units in first batch was estimated 450-600 by our community member. Review of DragonMint B29 [published](https://bitsonline.com/dragonmint-b29-blake-256-decred-miner/), people are [discussing](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8a2vul/just_unboxed_my_dragonmint_b29s/) shipping and running the miners.

By surprise Innosilicon [announced](https://twitter.com/Inno_Miner/status/986615352200118274) the sale of [D9 DecredMaster](http://www.innosilicon.com/html/d9-miner/index.html) ASIC miner with specs [identical](https://www.hashespersecond.com/2018/04/18/innosilicon-releases-blake2b-blake256-miners-that-mirror-halong-offerings/) to Halong B29 while being much cheaper ($6800 Inno vs $10499 Halong). Expected shipping date of the first batch is April 28-30. The company is active on their [bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3345156.0) thread, also see our [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8d7awu/innosilicon_releases_blake2b_blake256_miners_that/).

Just 9 days later Innosilicon [announced](https://twitter.com/Inno_Miner/status/990117591141134336) second batch with delivery on May 7-11 and same price of $6800. At the same time Halong B29 is [available](https://halongmining.com/shop/dragonmint-b29-blake256-miner/) again, this time $200 cheaper than Inno and delivery May 21-30. ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8fk2ao/decred_miners_back_in_stock_from_inno_and/))

As always, DYOR.

## Network

Hashrate: April started at 2.0-2.7 PH/s range and seen a general increase with some big [fluctuations](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8doiuo/question_about_network_hashrate_and_mining/) between lows at 2.2 and new all time high above 5.2 PH/s.

Nodes: there are 200 public listening and 500 normal nodes per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats) as of May 1. 169 nodes already upgraded to version 1.2.0. Some 30 nodes were observed to be testing Release Candidate versions before the final release.

Ticket price 30-day average has seen a steady rise to 87.5 DCR. Stake participation is solid 46.1% with 3.53 million DCR as of May 1.

## Integrations

Decred's Brazilian community made good progress on integrations this month.

> emiliomann: On April 2nd @Rhama will launch the first BR exchange of altcoins with fiat market and totally within the laws of the Brazilian government. Decred will have the two markets DCR/BTC and DCR/BRL. It’s very difficult to fulfill all the legal requirements and get authorization to work with FIAT here.

The exchange [turned](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/984105841048436741) out to be Profitfy. Profity is innovating by using dcrtime for their blockchain ID login via [Original My](https://originalmy.com). Great to see this deeper engagement with the tools that Decred provides, and not a surprise that it comes from @Rhama, who has been a community member since day one.

This seems to have spurred another exchange, Braziliex, to bring forward their [launch](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/984478905061928960) of DCR/BRL and DCR/BTC pairs, coming just 2 hours after Profitfy launched.

Not stopping there,

> emiliomann: Hey guys, this is a poll of the biggest Bitcoin exchange in Brazil that is planning to open altcoins markets. Please, help the Brazilian community by voting for Decred! Just one click. Thank you! https://twitter.com/mercadobitcoin/status/981602483268194307

Finally,

> viniciusfrias: We're excited to announce PagueCripto.com, a Brazilian crypto-to-fiat payment gateway which accepts Decred among other cryptocurrencies for Brazilians to pay daily bills, such as credit cards, energy, rent, etc, and also to make local bank transfers. Our service is both a web platform and an Android app, and as our community is relevant in Brazil, we are offering a discount coupon (50%) in service fees using DCR until May 14, 2018. Check it out at [paguecripto.com](https://www.paguecripto.com/) and in Google Play Store. ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C0NRMDVMJ/p1525043419000038))

[changenow.io](https://changenow.io/), a non-custodian exchange for fast conversions [added](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/981623403378454528) DCR.

> michae2xl: Decred is now available on [@ezBtcCanada](https://twitter.com/ezBtcCanada) — an exchange with DCR/CAD trading pair. From Toronto — https://www.ezbtc.ca/trade/alt-coins

i2Rav announced a new [trading desk](https://i2trading.com/) that will be offering DCR/EUR pair.

> Eventually we hope to offer the pair in GBP and YEN as well

You can see all exchanges known to support Decred in a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Iy2-3oqk-RUT7Fz0CaBcNI289o4YyAXBew86uNCCxQ/edit) maintained by snr01. Many of them are absent from coinmarketcap.

## Adoption

[The Crypto Lawyers, LLP](https://thecryptolawyers.com/), a crypto exclusive U.S. law firm began accepting Decred. ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8909x6/the_crypto_lawyers_a_crypto_exclusive_us_law_firm/))

> RAurelius: I think that a law firm accepting Decred is a worthy distinction from other previously publicized companies that accept Decred for typical consumer products. Legal services are severely lacking in the Crypto-sphere, so the publicity is good for everyone in this arena.

Great to see business owners reaching us directly in chat.

[VotoLegal](https://votolegal.com.br/) is [migrating](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/986699534888730624) from Ethereum to Decred blockchain:

> emiliomann: VotoLegal, a Brazilian project that uses blockchain technology to allow election campaign funding to be transparent and that all transactions conducted are tracked and made available to the citizens, now uses dcrtime and Decred blockchain.\

## Partnerships

YBF Ventures and Decred announced partnership in building a blockchain-focused development and business hub in Australia.

> With the YBF Ventures partnership, Decred hopes to grow their Australian contractor network and scale their operations throughout the Asia-Pacific region. ([btcmanager.com](https://btcmanager.com/ybf-ventures-partners-with-the-decred-project-to-build-a-decentralized-internet/))

> We specifically chose Decred for a more robust corporate partnership, and it is the first time that a decentralised autonomous organisation is partnering with a ‘traditional’ organisation in such a capacity. ([ybfventures.com](http://ybfventures.com/ybf-decred-partnership-web-3/))

## Community Discussions

A debate on protocol security and cost to attack. ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/89mvfd/key_security_flaws_in_decred_limits_the_security/))

Very thoughtful discussion on whether it is appropriate to use half naked photos in marketing, followed by meta-discussion how to handle very polarizing issues and unwanted contributions to the marketing efforts of a decentralized project. ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C5HPHMFQF/p1524182971000248), [continued](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PAYQJTW/p1524304298000029))

A new [#governance](https://decred.slack.com/messages/CAAMEU56W/) channel was created to discuss governance in Decred and other projects.

[r/politeia](https://www.reddit.com/r/politeia/) subreddit was recovered for Decred community. Thanks to Tivra for filing the request. Politeia can bring a lot of value outside Decred so it well deserves its own sub.

A new Slack [invite page](https://slack.decred.org/) has been [setup](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/990282234471989248) and onboarded 40 people in 48 hours.

Decred StackExchange site [proposal](https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/115865/decred) was closed due to inactivity in a 7 day period, according to Area 51 [rules](https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/20966/minimum-activity-requirements-for-area-51).

## Markets

In April Decred showed a confident recovery after previous months. DCR/USD moved from below $40 to nearly $90 and the more liquid DCR/BTC from 0.0058 to 0.0093.

OOOBTC showed unexpectedly huge DCR trading [volume](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/ooobtc/) of $19 m on April 10 ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8b40bj/ooobtc_exchange_moving_over_8_million_in_volume/)), it went back to normal 2 weeks later.

On April 25 a wild rush took the price from BTC 0.00777 to 0.0177 in under 30 minutes on Poloniex, with prices on other exchanges following to a lesser degree. Discussions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8eq566/uh_wtf_just_happened/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dcrtrader/comments/8eq5mm/holy_fing_hell_did_something_just_happen/).

## Relevant External

Bittrex finally opened registrations again.

ASIC debates are raging after Bitmain stealth-launched ASICs for Sia, Monero and Ethereum. Most opinions reflect on whether and how to resist ASICs, but some are recognizing the Decred way, like [this](https://tokeneconomy.co/is-the-war-against-asics-worth-fighting-b12c6a714bed) excellent piece.

## About This Update

This update was motivated by the desire to expose just how much is happening in Decred and save the time for people unable to actively follow our channels. It aims to cover all relevant developments with a short description and links to read further. It shows the depth of the project and the involvement of the community. We also plan to launch a newsletter and consider a [shorter version](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/issues/4) if there is such a demand.

This is the first issue and feedback is welcome to discover what is best for our readers. Please [join](https://slack.decred.org/) our Slack and write us on [#writers_room](https://decred.slack.com/messages/C9HC2NVTM/) or comment directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/issues).
