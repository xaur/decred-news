November #Decred Journal is here to bring you a detailed report on project's development, governance, network, new media content, and more.

Highlights:

* A huge proposal to change the distribution of Decred block rewards so that PoW miners get a much smaller share was published, discussed and has now been approved.

* The community has funded an outreach proposal after it was rejected by a Politeia vote. This is the first proposal funded without treasury.

* Politeia v1.3.0 is live in the wild, bringing improvements to the handling of proposal status, GUI improvements, and end-to-end testing.

* Two new reusable packages have been developed in dcrd, a general purpose one for fast big integers, and one for working with transaction scripts. That means more well tested and maintained building blocks for making Decred apps.
