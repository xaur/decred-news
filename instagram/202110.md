Hello #crypto Insta!

#Decred Journal is here to bring you a detailed report of October's development, governance, network, new media content, and more.

Highlights:

* The network has served 600,000 blocks without major hacks, rug pulls, or newsworthy drama. Nothing to see here!

* Politeia celebrated three years of operation. Average voter turnout increased significantly with 46% in year three, compared to 28% in year two. 20 proposals have been approved, mostly for software development, and mostly from existing contractors. 11 proposals got rejected.

* The mobile wallets proposal from raedah was funded for another year. The GoDCR desktop wallet proposal was rejected (49% out of 60% needed Yes) but a revised proposal is being prepared.

* Changes merged in DCRDEX make it possible to pay registration fees in BTC too (not only in DCR) and trade DCR/BTC using a built-in light wallet without running a Bitcoin full node.

P.S. Let us know in comments if Instagram announcements work better for you than Twitter/Reddit/etc and if we should keep making them.
