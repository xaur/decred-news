December #Decred Journal is here to bring you a detailed report on project's development, governance, network, new media content, and more.

Highlights:

* Decred's first payment to contractors from the new treasury was approved by a decentralized vote and sent.

* Development work for the DCP-10 consensus change was completed. It will change the PoW/PoS block reward split from 60%/30% to 10%/80% (10% will keep going to the treasury unchanged).

* Politeia v1.3.1 bugfix and polishing release was deployed.

* New participation records have been set in proposal voting, staking, and mixing systems.

* The first release candidates for core software v1.7 were opened for testing in early Jan.

* A proposal for funding the third phase of DCRDEX development was published in early Jan.
